Determining responsibility\u2014and liability\u2014while the developers of AI-based applications charge ahead, clinicians and healthcare institutions must temper their optimism with caution\u2014and with questions regarding who will be responsible when a patient is harmed. How can medical professionals and organizations take steps to protect patient safety? How can they shield themselves from responsibility for aspects of healthcare technology that belong with developers, not doctors?",
