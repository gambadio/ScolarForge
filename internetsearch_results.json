    "content": "AI analyzes medical data using subdomains such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), transforming diagnosis and treatment. Accurate and timely medical diagnosis is crucial for early detection and better treatment outcomes, and using AI to assist provides numerous benefits, including faster and more precise diagnoses, early disease detection and personalized treatments. It also automates routine tasks, easing the workload for healthcare professionals and detects subtle patterns in medical data that humans might miss.",
