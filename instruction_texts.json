Additional learning materials\ncan be found on the learning platform, but this course book should form the basis for your\nlearning.\nThe content of this course book is divided into units, which are divided further into sec-\ntions. Each section contains only one new key concept to allow you to quickly and effi-\nciently  add new learning material to your existing knowledge.\nAt the end of each section of the digital course book, you will find self-check questions.\nThese questions are designed to help you check whether you have understood the con-\ncepts in each section.\nFor all modules with a final exam, you must complete the knowledge tests on the learning\nplatform. You will pass the knowledge test for each unit when you answer at least 80% of\nthe questions correctly.\nWhen you have passed the knowledge tests for all the units, the course is considered fin-\nished and you will be able to register for the final assessment. Please ensure that you com-\nplete the evaluation prior to registering for the assessment.\nGood luck!\n8BASIC READING\nBell, J., & Waters, S. (2018).

These les-\nsons then introduce the different  types of IU International University of Applied Sciences\nexams, providing insight into their requirements and implementation.\nThis combination of theoretical principles and practical execution lays the foundation for\nthe future of scientific work.\n13UNIT 1\nTHEORY OF SCIENCE\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn the completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 the essential characteristics of scientific research.\n\u2013 how to distinguish between different  fundamental research assumptions.\n\u2013 how to identify core research decisions.1.THEORY OF SCIENCE\nCase Study\nSimon is studying business administration at IU International University of Applied Scien-\nces (IU) while also working at zielNET , a small market research company. Four years ago,\nhe successfully completed his training as a marketing and social research specialist at ziel-\nNET . During that time, he completed a written assignment that focused on how different\ncustomer groups formed their opinions.\nSimon loves getting to the bottom of things, as Goethe\u2019s Faust (1808/2005) says, \u201cTo know\nwhat holds the world together at its core\u201d . Having a particular interest in analyzing target\ngroups and group behavior is what led him to his current profession. Simon\u2019s supervisor\nappreciates this analytical quality and often  turns to him for advice on how to approach\nspecific consumer groups.\nCurrently, Simon is involved in an important project for zielNET: analyzing the recent prod-\nuct failure of a long-time major customer. Despite the fact that zielNET invested six\nmonths in the product\u2019s relaunch, customers still appear to have no interest in purchasing\nit. Simon now tries to address this issue empirically in his current course. What does it\nactually mean to work scientifically? He is trying to remember models and theories that\ndealt with consumer decisions and buying behavior of certain target groups and that\ncould be helpful for investigating the issue at hand.\n1.1 Introduction to Science and Research\nThis section begins with some key reflections on research and addresses scientific theory.\nThis may seem tedious and complicated at first, but it should quickly become clear that\nthe underlying structures of science have a major influence on our everyday lives. Addi-\ntionally, analytical tools will be provided to enable a critical examination of results of\nfuture research projects and their fundamental assumptions.\nCase Study: Observation, Reflection, and Reasoning\nThe following situation serves as a starting point for further discussion. Thousands of\nyears ago, a hunter and gatherer was out collecting branches of wood. On the way back to\nhis village, he stumbled and the branches fell to the ground. Understandably, his initial\nreaction was one of annoyance. However, he began to compare this situation with other\nprevious experiences and realized that things actually fall down again and again, but noth-\ning ever falls up. He continued to reflect and realized that this applies to all the things\naround him: tree branches, animals, stones, fruit, etc. Even the leaves that he recently col-\nlected for the shelter floor had fallen down, albeit more slowly. Some leaves were even\nblown away by the wind, an event which he had never observed with stones. At this point\n16he realized that everything he collects can fall down\u2014even if the speed of doing so differs\n\u2014but  nothing has the ability to fall up. He now wonders if other members of his tribe are\naware of this, or if they know of anything that falls up.\nWithout being able to provide answers to these questions, one could proceed as follows:\nFirst, the tribal elder could be questioned along with some other tribal members about\ntheir experiences with falling objects. However, their opinions may diverge. For example,\nthe tribal elder could remind him that the souls of the deceased ascend to the gods, i.e.,\nfall up, not down. Other tribal members might claim to have seen leaves fly up due to a\nparticularly strong wind. While there might be a few who swear that there are objects that\ndo fall upward, on the whole, there is agreement that the tendency is for most things to\nfall down, with estimates of speed varying greatly.\nAlthough these assessments point us in the right direction, many questions remain unan-\nswered. It is now necessary to consider how the whole phenomenon could be subjected to\na more detailed investigation.\nThe Science Council (2009) defines science as \u201cthe pursuit and application of knowledge\nand understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology\nbased on evidence\u201d . Science can also be defined as, \u201c[t]he intellectual and practical activ-\nity encompassing the systemic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and nat-\nural world through observation and experiment\u201d (Lexico.com, 2019a).\nScience usually means the process of research and, more precisely, scientific research.\nThe following definition applies: \u201cScientific research is conducted within the rules and\nconventions of science\u201d (Veal, 2018, p. 6).\nThis means that scientific research is a systematic, rule-based process used to gain knowl-\nedge. In the case above, the initial observation (branches fall down) cannot be considered\nto be at the level of scientific research yet; however, following a systematic and estab-\nlished process brings us closer to this goal.\nBased on scientific concepts broadly accepted today, such as the fact that gravity exists,\none can find out a lot about the subject of gravity. In fact, due to the ubiquitous availabil-\nity of information, some of these explanatory approaches and theories can now be regar-\nded as established knowledge. Therefore, one would certainly agree that the explanation\nof gravity can be regarded as true. But is that explanation incontrovertible? At this point,\none can refer again to the tribal elder talking about the ascending souls of the deceased.\nCan people be absolutely sure that such a thing does not exist? The question of whether\nsomething is considered true depends on the basic assumptions of our worldview.\nIt is known, for example, that witness statements after  accidents or crimes are often  unre-\nliable because different  witnesses can have completely different  recall about the event\nitself. One person swears that he heard three gun shots, while another person at the scene\nsays she heard only one gun shot. The vehicle fleeing the scene that caused the accident\nwas a blue SUV, says one person, while to someone else it appeared to be a black station\nwagon. Each of these individuals is absolutely convinced that they are telling the truth.\n17Indeed, there are many situations that people accept as true and at the same time remain\nquestionable, depending on certain basic assumptions people share. Here are a few exam-\nples.\nExample: True blue\nWhen someone refers to a blue house, there is an unspoken assumption that the house\nthey are referring to is painted blue. However, for a person who is color-blind, this descrip-\ntion is not their truth. Here it is assumed that the color-blind person is wrong, because\nthey cannot recognize the color blue. But is this really the case? Do people think of this\nperson as ill because they cannot see color? What would happen if color-blind people\nwere actually the dominant group and everyone else was suffering  from a \u201ccolor vision\u201d\nmutation? What if suddenly most people could no longer recognize colors and agreed that\nthe few remaining people who could see them were themselves ill? Then the blue house\nwould suddenly be something that does not even exist, since for the color-blind, it would\nbe a shade of gray. The description of a blue house would no longer be true; rather, the\ntruth\u2014as generally shared knowledge\u2014would be that the house is gray.\nOn the subject of \u201cwhat is truth\u201d , the following cognitive optical illusion serves as an illus-\ntration:\nFigure 1: Rubin\u2019s Vase\nSource: Becker-Carus & Wendt, 2017, p. 124.\nIn the image of Rubin\u2019s vase, is it true that two faces are depicted or is it true that a vase is\ndepicted? Or are both things true? This question of fact should be differentiated  from the\nquestion of what the observer sees. On closer examination, the central scientific frame-\nwork of observation also proves to be questionable.\n18Example: Global poverty\nAccording to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs  (2019) ,\nextreme poverty has risen in the United States; in Europe there has been an overall\ndecline, but the number of poor people is still higher than prior to the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn many countries, the gap between rich and poor continues to widen. For this purposes, a\n\u201crelative concept\u201d of poverty is used when discussing this topic. Relative poverty is \u201cdeter-\nmined by income distribution over a given population and defined according to societal\nnorms\u201d (Open Education Sociology Dictionary, 2020). According to the relative concept of\npoverty, someone is regarded as poor if that person earns less than 50 percent of the\nmedian income in the society they live in. This seems plausible and, according to the spe-\ncific definition given, is one true way of measuring poverty.\nAt this point, it should neither be discussed whether this concept of poverty makes sense,\nnor it should be denied that poverty is lamented in our societies. What is important here is\nthat this particular definition of poverty creates truths that are politically relevant and can\nalso be questioned. If in a country with 15 percent poverty, for example, all salaries were\ndoubled from one day to the next, the country would still have a deplorable poverty level\nof 15 percent. Mathematically this is correct, but is it true? This up for discussion.\nThe examples of color perception and poverty are intended to raise awareness to the fact\nthat scientific research produces results that are generally regarded as true. However, this\ntruth is always based on certain assumptions that must be considered when trying to\nunderstand and classify the results achieved. Statistics play a major role in societal and\npolitical contexts; however, it is often  very difficult  to evaluate the validity of \u201chard facts\u201d\nbecause information is lacking.\nGiven all these complex requirements, it seems quite challenging to become a successfull\nscholar; especially, when thinking of big names such as Einstein, Galileo Galilei, Marie\nCurie, and Maria Goeppert Mayer. However, research often  means going \u201ctwo steps for-\nward, one step back\u201d\u2014a slow and steady process that allows even novice researchers to\nbe successful.\nScientific research produces findings that can be regarded as true in the sense that\nresearchers\u2019 assumptions are known and shared. Nutritional recommendations over the\nlast 60 years, for example, have been based on scientific research. Meat diets, carbohy-\ndrate diets, low-carb programs, interval fasting, therapeutic fasting, moderate alcohol\nconsumption, no alcohol consumption, the Mayo diet, etc., all came about because of sci-\nentific recommendations and findings that resulted in facts being recognized as \u201ctruth\u201d .\nHowever, scientific findings are also opportunities for critique. Criticism is an extremely\nimportant part of the scientific research process because it gives rise to new ideas for\nfuture research projects. During this course you will acquire the tools to understand\nresearch, critically question it, and develop your own research approaches.\nWith regard to the relevance of research, it can be stated that research findings are not\nonly used to explain existing conditions, but also partly to predict future developments.\nHere are some examples of scientific questions:\n19\u2022Why is Apple in a position to market mobile phones and computers at substantially\nhigher prices than its competitors while offering  essentially the same performance?\n\u2022How does international milk consumption affect  the CO2 balance of the environment\nand thus climate change?\n\u2022How can agile leadership in medium-sized production companies influence efficiency\nand productivity?\nThese examples convey a first impression of how complex open questions can be, includ-\ning all their conceivable sub-aspects, in the broad field of science and research.\n1.2 Research Paradigms\nResearch, and the way in which scientific research is approached, has a lot to do with\nunderlying assumptions. There is a need to review the steps that prior studies have taken\nand to also think about the basic assumptions of the own research project. These basic\nassumptions are also referred to in the literature as paradigms or, more precisely, as\nresearch paradigms. Research paradigms are the most fundamental convictions from\nwhich knowledge is gained in the research process (Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Saunders et al.,\n2019, pp. 138\u2013151). Depending on the research question, different  positions can be taken:\nScenarios A and B will be used for comparison:\nA. How does the acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h of a vehicle change when special gaso-\nline is used as fuel as compared to the use of normal gasoline?\nB. How do leaders of social organizations evaluate their own ethical approach when deter-\nmining an organization-wide ethical orientation, according to Swiss economist Peter\nUlrich?\nWhen having a look at both questions, it is immediately apparent that each question\nrequires a different  scientific approach to find the answer. In scenario A, an experiment\nwill most likely be carried out in which the same vehicle will be refueled once with normal\ngasoline and once with special gasoline, the exact same acceleration conditions will be\nutilized, and a time measurement will be carried out. In addition, the testing conditions\nwill be reproduced as exactly as possible to generate a reliable conclusion, i.e., weather\nconditions and subsurface conditions will be replicated.\nIn scenario B, attitudes of a particular group of people\u2014leaders in social organizations\u2014\nneed to be investigated. The organizations themselves can vary greatly, as can the atti-\ntudes about ethics; the latter is based strongly on the values held by the survey respond-\nents. The standardization of the research process tends to be more difficult  than in sce-\nnario A as there are many influences on the respondents and on the survey situation that\nare difficult  to standardize and control.\n20These two research scenarios illustrate different  underlying scientific assumptions\u2014\nresearch paradigms. In order to understand the path to knowledge for both scenarios, four\nquestions are typically asked (Guba & Lincoln, 1994, pp. 107\u2013108 ; Saunders et al., 2019,\npp. 144\u2013151):\n\u2022Ontology: What is truth? What can a person say is true?\n\u2022Epistemology: What can humans know?\n\u2022Methodology: What instruments can be used to gain knowledge?\n\u2022Influence of the researcher: To what extent does the researcher influence the research\nresults?\nWhen looking at these four questions, the differences  between scenarios A and B become\nclear. For scenario A, it can be assumed that there must be an unambiguous result for the\nacceleration behavior of the different  types of gas (ontology) and that this result is also\nexactly measurable and reproducible (epistemology). If the test arrangements are identi-\ncal for both gas options, the results are not open for interpretation and can therefore be\nregarded as objectively true. Methodically, one will almost certainly conduct an experi-\nment in which one leaves all conditions as similar as possible and only changes the gas\nused (methodology). In this respect, the influence of the researcher is kept out of the\nresearch process as much as possible (influence of the researcher).\nIn scenario B, while talking to leaders of organizations will definitely deliver relevant\ninsights, the \u201ctruth\u201d here will manifest itself in interpretation-related tendencies (ontol-\nogy). Therefore, it will be difficult  to arrive at a definitive and unequivocal conclusion\n(epistemology). In methodological terms, an experiment does not seem to apply to this\nscenario, rather one would most likely use open questions so that the managers can\nexpress themselves freely (methodology). In such a survey, influences of the researcher\nare hard to eliminate because factors such as the type of question, mood, preferences,\nand dislikes can be important influencing factors (influence of the researcher). The result\nis not a measurable value as in scenario A, but rather an assessment based on interpreta-\ntion.\nScenario A is presumably based on an \u201cexplanatory research paradigm\u201d (Saunders et al.,\n2019, p. 144\u2013147; Gubrium, 2012, p. 417). In the literature, this paradigm is also called\n\u201cpositivism\u201d and includes different  versions. However, it is not necessary to go into more\ndetail on this here. Scenario B is based on an \u201cunderstanding research paradigm\u201d ( Guba &\nLincoln, 1994, pp. 110\u2013116; Gubrium, 2012, p. 417), often  referred to as \u201cconstructivism\u201d , of\nwhich again there are different  versions but will not be expanded upon here. The following\ntable gives an overview of the most important points for each research paradigm.\nTable 1: Fundamental Research Paradigms\nParadigm Explanatory Paradigm Understanding Paradigm\nOntology:\nWhat is truth? What can one say\nis true?A person can make statements\nabout reality (objects, living\ncreatures, etc., in the world).Reality occurs in humans\nthrough experiences, attitudes,\nand surroundings.\n21Paradigm Explanatory Paradigm Understanding Paradigm\nEpistemology:\nWhat can humans know?Objectifiable conditions:\nInsights and findings are meas-\nurable and also exist for multi-\nple people.Generally subjective insights\nand findings arise through inter-\nactions and interpretation pro-\ncesses.\nMethodology:\nWhat instruments can be used\nto gain knowledge?Experimental methods, standar-\ndized methods, quantitative\nmethodsInterpretative methods, qualita-\ntive methods\nInfluence of the Researcher:\nTo what extent does the\nresearcher influence the\nresearch results?Influence is excluded as much as\npossible.Subjectivity of the researchers:\nThey are involved in the\nresearch process because no\ninterpretation would be possible\nwithout them.\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nThus, an explanatory research paradigm searches for universally valid laws by subjecting\ntheories or assumptions to a test in order to either confirm (verify) or refute (falsify) their\nuniversality. Since reality here is regarded as non-individual\u2014i.e., independent of the indi-\nvidual\u2014one tries to exclude the subjectivity of the researcher as much as possible. In con-\ntrast, the understanding research paradigm assumes that reality is always constructed by\nthe individual and arises through interpretation. In this respect, the subjectivity of the\nresearcher is an integral part of the research process. An understanding research paradigm\noften  motivates research fields in which little or no theoretical approaches exist.\nEach research paradigm has a different  impact on the further development of research\nstrategies. It is important to note that no paradigm is considered \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201csuperior\u201d ,\nrather each research paradigm has its relevance in different  fields of research, often  even\ncomplementing each other.\n1.3 Research Decisions\nResearch paradigms determine the way research is conducted. Furthermore, research\nquestions often  already allow to make conclusions about the underlying assumptions. For\na research question to be asked, the central ideas for carrying out the investigation must\nbe formulated in advance. There are several research decisions to be considered which is\nalso referred to as research design. The following decisions, among others, have to be\nmade ( Bazeley, 2004, p. 141 ; Bell & Waters, 2018, pp. 23\u201346 ; Creswell & Creswell, 2018, pp.\n3\u201321):\n\u2022type of research strategy\n\u2022type of scientific reasoning\n\u2022type of data\n\u2022type of research to be carried out\n22Quantitative research\nThis type of research\ngathers numerical data\nand analyzes it via mathe-\nmatical methods.\nQualitative research\nThis type of research\ngathers non-numerical\ndata and analyzes it\nthrough meaning inter-\npretation.\nCorrelation\nIf two phenomena are\nrelated in some way or\nhave some sort of con-\nnection, they are consid-\nered correlated.Type of Research Strategy\nThis research decision is aimed at the question and choice of methodology, of whether\nresearch should be quantitative or qualitative. Research is primarily about collecting, ana-\nlyzing, and interpreting data, data that sometimes can be very different  in nature. Quanti-\ntative research  aims at results that can be expressed in data, e.g., sales figures or average\nlength of stay in health care facilities (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 176\u2013178). In quantitative\nresearch, a mathematically comprehensible, mathematically \u201ccorrect\u201d result is obtained\nand thus the research arrives at a statement whose accuracy \u2014 assuming mathematically\nprecise procedures were followed \u2014 cannot be refuted. However, the interpretative aspect\nof quantitative research is often  \u201chidden\u201d in the translation or reduction of complex terms\ninto numerical scales (e.g., the term \u201cquality of life\u201d in clinical studies on patients at the\nend of their lives). In quantitative research, representativeness is also important, i.e., the\nextent to which the result obtained for a sample can be generalized to the population as a\nwhole. A good example is election research, which typically involves 1,000 or 2,000 people\nin an attempt to obtain a representative picture of the general population (i.e., the entire\nelectorate). In quantitative studies, relatively large samples are often  used to test previ-\nously established hypotheses, and the resulting data are summarized.\nQualitative research  uses, amongst others, text-based data that must be interpreted, i.e.,\nqualitative research examines the individual case (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 179\u2013180). In\nqualitative research, the result is a conclusion obtained from an interpretative process.\nBecause interpretation is by nature subjective, the results of such research are up for\ndebate and their validity can be questioned. Therefore, qualitative research typically does\nnot aim at representativeness. Rather, specific participants are selected, with the expecta-\ntion that they can provide in-depth insights into the subject being researched. Due to the\nvery complex process of data collection and analysis, it is usually only possible to work\nwith small samples when performing qualitative research. For example, researchers might\nbe interested in the reasons why people do not vote in an election. In order to explore\ndeeper motives here, interviews with a few participants are conducted where they explain\nin depth why they do not vote in elections. The aim is to obtain useful and rich informa-\ntion. In addition, one might want to ask why job turnover in certain industries is higher\nthan in others. Here, interviews capture motives and underlying causes and are discussed\nin confidentiality; the information gathered from these interviews might otherwise not\nhave been obtained with a standardized questionnaire.\nQuantitative research is sometimes said to mean that mathematical accuracy does not\nautomatically mean \u201ccorrect\u201d with regard to research questions. This is how, for example,\nmistakes are made confusing correlation with causality (Reed, 2005 as cited in Saunders et\nal., 2019, p. 148). A light-hearted example can be that the number of human births per year\nin Germany and the number of storks (which are said to fly the babies to the expecting\nparents\u2019 homes) living in Germany have both declined considerably over the last 70 years.\nIf the biology department was not paying attention, they might immediately conclude\nthat there are fewer children in Germany today because there are also fewer baby-bring-\ning storks. Here, the numbers actually correlate , but the causality  is not given.\n23Causality\nIf one phenomenon is\nfound to affect  or influ-\nence another, they are\nsaid to have a causal rela-\ntionship.\nInduction\nThis is a process by which\nindividual cases are used\nto derive a generalization.\nDeduction\nThis is a process by which\na general premise is\napplied to specific, indi-\nvidual cases.Qualitative research is often  assumed to be pure storytelling, and, in this respect, one\noften  speaks of anecdotal evidence. This means that something is recognized as a\nresearch result because it has been said often  enough. This is associated with the accusa-\ntion that scientists using qualitative research only find out what they assume ( Diefenbach,\n2009 ). If, for example, female participants in middle management of a company are asked\nabout the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d (the phenomenon in which women are discriminated against\nwhen seeking leadership positions), it is more likely than not that the interviewees\nactually confirm the existence of the glass ceiling in their statements. Here the result is\nexpected\u2014the knowledge gain remains small because it is obvious that the researchers\nasked questions for which they already knew the answers. It is therefore particularly\nimportant in qualitative research to reflect on one's own research process and to analyze\nit critically.\nLooking at these two very different  research strategies\u2014quantitative and qualitative\nresearch designs\u2014the ongoing scientific debate about which approach is \u201cbetter\u201d is easily\nunderstood ( Bell & Waters, 2018, pp. 23\u201327). In fact, one can argue that there is no \u201cbetter\napproach\u201d per se, but that either research strategy is ideal depending on the particular\nresearch project. For example, for large samples, a research object that can be easily\nquantified, and the requirement for generalizability (i.e., representativeness) of the results\nwould definitively lead to quantitative research. The desire to gain deeper insights into a\nlittle-explored field with more text-based data makes qualitative research design seem\nreasonable. Researching employee satisfaction in a company would probably be better\ndetermined quantitatively, whereas conflict and trauma within teams would be investiga-\nted more qualitatively. The sciences and humanities understand that these approaches do\nnot contradict each other, but can also be used together in a process called triangulation.\nTypes of Scientific Reasoning\nThe second research decision concerns scientific reasoning. Here a distinction between\ninduction and deduction is drawn, both closely linked to underlying research parameters\nand the decision for a qualitative or quantitative research strategy (Saunders et al., 2019,\npp. 152\u2013155).\nInduction  first looks at an individual case or a few cases and draws general conclusions\n(Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 154\u2013155; Veal, 2018, pp. 48\u201351; Sheppard, 2004, pp. 49\u201352). If\none has no knowledge of car brands and their specific characteristics, but a Ferrari passes\nyou on the road, you might conclude that Ferraris are always very fast cars. Although you\nmay be familiar with this car maker, it could have been pure coincidence and all other Fer-\nraris are totally underpowered, slow vehicles. Induction is therefore often  used to develop\na theory from a few single cases, which one could test further, with more observations, so\nas to achieve a more solid conclusion.\nDeduction  is the opposite of induction and moves from general conclusions to individual\ncases. Typically, a theory is used, and this theory is tested on a case-by-case basis ( Saun-\nders et al., 2019, pp. 152\u2013154; Veal, 2018, pp. 48\u201351; Sheppard, 2004, pp. 49\u201352). If the\ntheory states that all Ferraris are particularly fast cars, then it follows that a Ferrari stand-\ning on the street in a residential area must be a fast car. To be on the safe side, the theory\n24Primary and secondary\ndata\nPrimary data are gener-\nated for the investigation,\nwhile secondary data\nwere originally collected\nfor a purpose outside the\nresearch project.\nExperimental investiga-\ntions\nThese types of investiga-\ntions take place in a plan-\nned environment.(all Ferraris are fast cars) would be investigated by testing the Ferrari. If the car proves to\nbe fast, the theory would be confirmed; if the Ferrari is slow for any reason, the theory\nwould be refuted or falsified.\nQuantitative research usually uses deduction. Induction is more common in qualitative\nresearch; however, there are times when deductive approaches are taken.\nType of Data\nWhen it comes to the basic decisions of research, it is important to consider the different\ntypes of data. A distinction is made between primary and secondary data (Veal, 2018, p.\n52; Rea & Parker, 2014, pp. 4\u20135). Primary data are generated for the purpose of the current\ninvestigation. Therefore, when interviews are conducted, the interview records are consid-\nered primary data. The same applies with regard to participants\u2019 individual answers on\nstandardized questionnaires. The primary use of such data is for the researcher who col-\nlected the data.\nSecondary data are data originally collected for a different  purpose, which is then used for\na new and different  investigation (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 316\u2013318; Tantawi, 2021). For\nexample, if a market research institute uses economic data to draw an absolute compari-\nson between two countries, and a different  research group uses the same data to analyze\nwhether there is a correlation between religious affiliations  and economic data of various\ncountries, the data are known as secondary data.\nType of Research to Be Carried Out\nHow research is implemented is also part of the fundamental decisions of research. Here,\na distinction is made between experimental  and non-experimental investigations ( Cres-\nwell & Creswell, 2018, pp. 11\u201313). One possibility of non-experimental investigation is the\n\u201cfield-research\u201d . This type of research is carried out \u201cin real life\u201d (Arrington, 2021 ), e.g.,\ninterviews with managers at their workplace. It is particularly important for observations\nto study participants\u2019 behavior in real context and then analyze it. Experimental research\nmeans creating a controlled environment in which investigations will be carried out. The\nadvantage here is that the environment is controlled and any interference can be ruled\nout (Stoica, 2021). In marketing, for example, laboratory supermarkets (i.e., those that\nonly simulate the shopping situation) are used to investigate whether and how customers\ncan be encouraged to buy certain products. The fact that a shelf with sweets is typically\nfound at the cash register is probably the result of experimental studies in which it was\nestablished that children like to \u201cmotivate\u201d their parents to buy another chocolate bar\nwhile waiting in the checkout line.\nThe research decisions mentioned here represent some of the cornerstones of research\nupon which data collection and analysis can be built and planned.\n251.4 Impact of Scientific Paradigms on\nResearch Design\nThe essential assumptions about research have a direct impact on research design ( Saun-\nders et al., 2019, pp. 128\u2013132; 172\u2013175). Since research paradigms allow conclusions to be\ndrawn about the underlying assumptions of research, this results in a logically stringent\nsequence of research design. Research is a process that one follows, much like a formula.\nAccordingly, it must be possible to establish, critically reflect upon, and justify the\nresearch approach.\nThe following graphic provides information on the connection between research para-\ndigms and research design.\nFigure 2: Connections between Basic Research Decisions\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nThe figure illustrates that with the formulation of the research question and the research\nobject, a large part of the research decisions have already been made, or at least a specific\nresearch strategy appears probable. The following two examples provide further informa-\ntion.\nExample: Introducing rent control\n26The government plans to introduce new legislation to limit rent increases (rent control)\nand institutional landlords will be questioned about their attitude to such regulation and\nthe associated challenges. The research question is formulated:\nHow do institutional landlords assess the introduction of rent control in relation to their busi-\nness model?\nFrom this question one would lean more toward an understanding research paradigm,\nsince it is clearly a question of personal assessment. This offers  a qualitative research\nstrategy that focuses on the analysis of text-based data. The form of scientific reasoning\nmay tend to be more inductive, as a few cases are considered and theory is generated\nrather than tested. If experts from rental companies should be interviewed, primary data\nwould be generated. If the survey were to take place at the workplace of the interviewees,\nit would be a non-experimental research design.\nExample: Kids and chocolate\nThe goal is to discover whether parents who shop with their children buy more of the\nchocolate bars prominently displayed at supermarket checkouts than adults who shop\nalone. The following research question is formulated for this purpose:\nHow does buying behavior change with regard to chocolate bars offered  at supermarket check-\nouts when adults go shopping with their children?\nHere one can assume a rather explanatory paradigm, since number-based data are most\nlikely used and a representative research result is the goal. In this respect, a quantitative\nresearch strategy can be assumed and thus also a deductive\u2014in this case theory-tested\u2014\nform of scientific reasoning. If video recordings of a laboratory supermarket in which a\nresearch institute originally observed the buyers in relation to a different  issue were used,\nsecondary data would now be employed when using the recording for this research. The\nsetting corresponds to an experimental research design.\nResearch should be structured in categories so that the readers seeking results can under-\nstand and comprehend the process and outcomes. This still leaves room for criticism and\ndiscussion, both of which are highly important as this is the base upon which scientific\nprogress is built.\nSUMMARY\nScience and research differ  to a considerable extent from the everyday\nknowledge and experience of an individual. In this unit, scientific theo-\nries have been introduced in order to provide initial insight into availa-\nble research paradigms. These theories serve as a starting point for sci-\nentists and academics to make important research decisions and to\nchoose which research design works best for their empirical and/or\n27experimental inquiry. With the help of practical examples and scenarios,\nan application-oriented introduction to this often  very abstract and\nchallenging subject is provided.\n28UNIT 2\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION OF GOOD\nSCIENCE\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned \u2026\n\u2013 about the importance of ethics in research.\n\u2013 how to verify and evaluate the quality of scientific studies and research.\n\u2013 when using a non-disclosure agreement and affidavit  is required.\n\u2013 what role spelling and structure have in academic writing.\n\u2013 how to identify a topic and continuously narrow the research question.\n\u2013 how to develop a research question and use it to scaffold  academic work.2.PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF GOOD\nSCIENCE\nCase Study\nMaike is an ambitious employee in a large company. In order to advance further in the\ncompany, she has decided to go back to school part-time to pursue a bachelor degree.\nWhile the content of her studies interests her, she quickly realizes that she has difficulties\nwith academic work. The first written assignment is already torturous for Maike, making\nher uneasy about her bachelor thesis, which requires an empirical study. She will need to\nconduct an investigation and either develop or test hypotheses, depending on which\nresearch paradigm she chooses. Eventually Maike decides to test a hypothesis empirically\nfor her second research essay, which is due soon. She chooses a qualitative approach\nwithout knowing whether it is suitable for her research question. Ascertaining the research\ndesign and data collection become quite complicated, and, after  a third failed interview,\nshe is about to give up altogether. The pressure is mounting and the due date is fast\napproaching. In her distress, she invents the missing interviews and lets a fellow student\u2014\nJoana\u2014do most of the analysis. To thank Joana for her help, she invites her to a popular\nmusic concert. Maike submits her essay on time and states in the affidavit  that she carried\nout the research independently without the help of others\u2014only making mention of her\nacquaintance Joana, in the acknowledgments. Despite the weak scientific basis of the\nwork, she is compelled by her professor to publish the results in an IU paper, making them\navailable to the broader scientific community. Maike now has moral dilemma because she\nmanipulated her data. She is afraid that a larger number of critical readers will increase\nthe possibility that someone will discover her deception, especially when she learns that\nher work will be scanned by plagiarism software.\nIn the specific case of Maike, many questions can be asked with regard to good scientific\npractice.\n\u2022Why is honesty important, not only morally, but even existentially, in scientific research?\n\u2022What drives researchers to manipulate or falsify results?\n\u2022How can an outsider judge whether a study is trustworthy and qualitatively reliable?\n\u2022How can students avoid such early defeat and demotivation with academic writing?\nIt is important to show students how to apply and implement good scientific practice from\nthe very beginning. The following content on how to implement good scientific applica-\ntion should be practiced with all IU-specific examinations, and in particular with data pro-\ntection, affidavits,  correct spelling and formatting, and topic identification or differentia-\ntion.\n30CUDOS principles\nThese principles describe\nthe four basic ethical\nnorms in scientific\nresearch.2.1 Research Ethics\nWhen it comes to ethics in research, many people likely think of crimes committed against\ngroups of people in the name of scientific progress. Throughout the history of modern sci-\nence, people who did not have the power or the knowledge to defend themselves were\nexploited in experiments in the name of scientific or medical progress in a way that today\nare considered immoral. Especially in medicine, which starts with the ethos of healing\npeople or at least alleviating suffering,  such trials are a particular outrage, as with the infa-\nmous Tuskegee study in Alabama, USA from 1932 to 1972 ( Benedek, 1978). This study\ninvestigated the natural course of syphilis; however, the African-American male patients\nwere neither told what they were suffering  from nor given access to medication, causing\nmany to die in agony.\nEthical issues naturally arise in other disciplines as well. In the economic and social scien-\nces, for example, protecting study participants\u2019 data and personal information is becom-\ning both ever more important and challenging. As gradually the private and the public\nwith increasing social media use is mixed, it is becoming very difficult  for researchers to\neffectively  protect study participants from the misuse of data collected (Canadian Insti-\ntutes of Health Research et al., 2018; Saunders et al., 2019, p. 259).\nHowever, ethical issues need to be taken into account right from the beginning of any\nresearch project and need to be present with every step of a work that claims to be scien-\ntific (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 252). Why? Postulating scientific results means claiming\ntruth. The concept of truth\u2014also scientific truth\u2014is highly complex and books written on\nthis subject fill the library shelves of all major universities ( Ghins, 2017 ). Put simply, relia-\nbility and accessibility of scientific results form a basis for the work of all scientists world-\nwide\u2014the scientific community. Thus, it is essential that scholars respect academic hon-\nesty and can be trusted. It is this honesty that encompasses all the steps necessary for\nscientific insight and discovery. From topic selection to publication, incentives and pres-\nsure can become so high that researchers could find themselves guided by motives other\nthan those grounded in the pursuit of science and truth.\nRobert King Merton, an American sociologist and science theorist, formulated ethical\nnorms that are still regarded as the foundation for science (as a system or institution),\neven as they are constantly adapted and redefined over time (Bucchi, 2015).\nAccording to Merton, these standards are also referred to as CUDOS principles  (Merton,\n1973) and include the following.\n1. Communism: Scientific knowledge does not belong to the individual researcher, but\nrather to the scientific community and society as a whole, which carries and facilitates\nall research. Scientific results can only be recognized when published and made avail-\nable to the community.\n2. Universalism: Scientific statements are valid regardless of the social class, religion,\nrace, or other characteristics of the researcher. Scientists should only be judged on the\nbasis of their scientific performance.\n313. Disinterestedness: Scientists and scientific institutions may only act for the sake of\nscientific progress and not for personal reasons (e.g., career, political opportunity).\n4. Organized skepticism: Scientific results should not simply be believed, but must be\nreviewed by the researcher and by the scientific community; only then can scientific\ntruth be affirmed.  This control must be anchored in scientific institutions and in the\nbroader scientific system.\nRobert Merton (1973) postulated these norms not so much for the individual researcher\u2019s\nmorality\u2014it was clear to him that scientists are people just like everyone else\u2014but rather\nfor the institution or system of science, which, in his opinion, cannot exist without these\nfoundational norms.\nIt is not difficult  to imagine in how many places these principles are challenged today:\nauthorship in the digital age; the increased competitive pressure among researchers to\npublish quickly and frequently (how, for example, can the scientific community still accu-\nrately check the flood of publications?); and influential persons and institutions (\u201cgate\nkeepers\u201d; Bucchi, 2015) who determine who gets what position or which research grants,\netc. The list of breaking points for honest research goes on and on. After  a few blatant,\npublic cases of scientific misconduct, almost all major national and international research\nsocieties, universities, and other scientific institutions have created for themselves a repu-\ntable set of standards for scientific work, its review, and implementation (for the U.S. and\nCanada, as well as some international guidelines, see the compilation of The University of\nBritish Columbia, 2019 or Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 254\u2013255).\nSaunders et al. (2019, pp. 257\u2013259) considered ten ethicals principles, that occur across\nmany different  approaches for research:\n\u2022integrity, fairness and open-mindedness of the researcher\n\u2022respect for others\n\u2022avoidance of harm (non-maleficence)\n\u2022privacy of those taking part\n\u2022voluntary nature of participation and right to withdraw\n\u2022informed consent of those taking part\n\u2022ensuring confidentiality of data and maintenance of anonymity of those taking part\n\u2022responsibility in the analysis of data and reporting of findings\n\u2022compliance in the management of data\n\u2022ensuring the safety of the researcher\nOne could perhaps formulate a brief summary of the international efforts  toward scientific\nhonesty in this way: anyone who produces sloppy work, deliberately conceals, falsifies, or\ninvents results, or does not appreciate employees, destroys the possibility of science. If\nthe scientific community and its institutions cannot establish rules, verify compliance, and\nenforce them, not only will the reputation of science be damaged, but science itself will no\nlonger have a chance to pursue the discovery of universal truths.\n322.2 Evidence\nAfter  exploring ethics in research, it is necessary to examine the role of evidence in science\n(Elsevier Author Services, n.d.). However, first, a few words about the term \u201cevidence\u201d . Evi-\ndence is a much-discussed term in philosophy and science (philosophers such as Ludwig\nWittgenstein and Edmund Husserl, for example, could be mentioned here). Generally\nspeaking, evidence is \u201cthe available body of facts or information indicating whether a\nbelief or proposition is true or valid\u201d (Lexico.com, 2019b).\nIt is important to mention that not every study meets the standards of good science\n(Elsevier Author Service, n.d.). Studies show differences  regarding the quality of research\ndesign, implementation, and review. So, how can one determine whether or not an experi-\nment is reliable and qualitatively acceptable? This question may surprise some, as it is\ngenerally assumed that scientific studies always provide new and reliable results. Unfortu-\nnately, this is not always the case. This makes it all the more important to subject studies\nto a review. In order to assess whether a study provides reliable data, it is important to\ndetermine the reason why the experiment was conducted and what question it investiga-\nted. This may sound trivial, but it is crucial in order to determine whether the study is able\nto thoroughly answer the research question. Subsequently, the methodology of the study\nshould be considered, in particular whether the methodology used was appropriate to\nanswer the research question, whether it was carried out properly, and whether there\nwere systemic errors (bias) that could distort the results.\nThe following questions can help to evaluate studies:\n\u2022Is the study design suitable to answering the research question?\n\u2022How were the participants approached and selected?\n\u2022Who or what was included/excluded and why?\n\u2022Did the researchers describe the procedure and the results completely and comprehen-\nsibly so that the study could be repeated and reviewed?\n\u2022Were the samples large enough and the number of experiments frequent enough to\nanswer the research question?\n\u2022Was the study conducted long enough?\n\u2022How many participants or testing arrangements/experiments were eliminated or unsuc-\ncessful during the study and why?\n\u2022How many participants or experiments could no longer be investigated during the\nperiod post-study (for follow up) and why?\n\u2022Was the study conducted by an independent institution or by the private sector?\n\u2022Are the samples and number of tests performed representative and sufficient  to estab-\nlish conclusive evidence?\nIn addition to this fundamental assessment and evaluation of a research study, there are\nlevels of evidence, or classifications of evidence, that provide information on whether\nresearch is of high quality and whether its results can be scientifically communicated.\n33Meta-analysis\nThis method tries to stat-\nistically summarize early\nresearch projects on a\ncertain topic. It is a sum-\nmary of many sources of\nprimary data.\nRandomization\nIn this procedure, partici-\npants are assigned to dif-\nferent groups in an\nunplanned manner.\u201cEvidence class\u201d is a term mainly used in evidence-based medicine to describe and cate-\ngorize the formal and substantive quality of a study. It describes a hierarchy of evidence.\nThe scientific significance is thus evaluated with the help of evidence classes, or levels of\nevidence (Elsevier Author Services, n.d.). The five levels of evidence hierarchy are ( Man-\ntzoukas, 2007, p. 217):\n\u2022Level 1: Evidence from at least one meta-analysis  of RCTs (Randomized Controlled\nTrails)\n\u2022Level 2: Evidence from at least one well-Conducted RCT\n\u2022Level 3: Evidence from controlled research without randomization\n\u2022Level 4: Evidence based on research without experimental study\n\u2022Level 5: Evidence based on opinions/reports of recognized authorities\nDefinition of evidence levels or classes may vary between organizations and differ\nbetween specialties, according to the clinical question being asked (Murad et al., 2016 ;\nBurns, 2011).\n2.3 Data Protection, Affidavit,  and\nGeneral Legal Information\nIn many research areas, working with personal data is inevitable, whether it is a written\ndata record, video recordings, or images. All of these possible empirical sources and infor-\nmation are subject to data protection regulations. Those working in scientific research\nmust therefore know and comply with the applicable regulations, consistently implement-\ning them in their scientific practice (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 276). In the following, aspects\nof data protection that must be taken into account in academic writing will be explored.\nCollection of Personal Data within the Scope of Surveys\nIf the survey requires personal information, i.e., if the respondents can be identified, vari-\nous data protection measures must be put in place (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 276\u2013278 ).\nThis is also the case even if a name or other personal data are not identifiable and are\nreplaced or redacted, making it very difficult  to identify the person in question; in such a\ncase, one speaks of pseudonymity. Regardless, pseudonymous surveys must be treated\njust like surveys containing personal data.\nExamples of such guidelines include\n\u2022data minimization. Collecting too much personal data should be avoided. (What data\nare absolutely required for the purpose of the survey and how do they have to be for the\nresearch purpose?).\n\u2022legality. The collection and processing of personal data may have a legal basis. If there\nis no legal permission for the processing of data, the consent of the interviewee must be\nobtained.\n34\u2022deletion of data. Personal data must be deleted as soon as they are no longer needed.\nFor scientific surveys, the data must be kept for ten years, even if the survey is part of an\nexamination. At the end of the ten-year period, the data must be deleted.\nWhen disseminating or publishing the results of scientific surveys, all personal informa-\ntion should be removed beforehand. For example, if a student conducts a survey that is\npart of a research essay, the survey participant data should be pseudonymized before the\nessay is submitted. This means that names must be replaced by pseudonyms or com-\npletely redacted. No names should be visible so as to ensure the anonymity of the inter-\nviewee.\nIf no personal data is collected and/or used in a survey, no data protection consent has to\nbe obtained. Personal data is not collected or used if the data is completely anonymous,\ni.e., if it is not possible to draw conclusions about the person or an attribution to a person.\nCopyright Laws\nThe use of graphics and photos in academic work can be tricky, especially when figuring\nout who owns the graphic or photo in question and if consent is given for its use in text\nand on other platforms, such as on social media. In order to use such images, one must\nfollow the law of the country. The regulations for using photographs in Germany, for\nexample, are clear: all photographs are protected by copyright (\u00a7 72 UrhG).\nThe following provides clarification on the usage of graphics and images when submitting\nan academic paper in Germany, respectively on a university located in Germany.\nUse of images (without personal reference)\nImages, graphics, and maps that have been previously published (e.g., available online)\nmay only be used if the work references them. This means that there must be a a relation-\nship between the image and the text (Section 51 No. 1 UrhG). In addition, the creator of\nthe image needs to be cited. The Citation Guidelines show how to correctly cite images.\nQuestions:\n1. Is this image necessary?\n2. Does the idea remain valid without the image?\n3. If a trademark (image, text, water mark, etc.) is depicted in the image in question, the\nfollowing applies: In principle, trademarks (logos) are also protected by copyright. It\nmust not appear that there is a relationship between the trademark proprietor and\nthe user if there is actually none. A copyright infringement of a trademark is excluded\nif it is only an \u201cinsignificant accessory\u201d in the overall image. The decisive factor for this\nis that the object protected by copyright and trademark law cannot be the main\ndesign of the image (e.g., a company sign in the image of a large shopping street).\nIcons are also protected by copyright. If icons are used, the creator of the icon should\nalso be named, unless the icon is in the public domain.\n35Concerning media, Microsoft  grants a license for its products such as Word and Power-\nPoint in projects and documents to copy, distribute, and display media elements (images,\nclip art, animations, sounds, music, video clips, templates, and other types of content)\nthat are part of the software.  The content contained in those programs may therefore be\nused for handouts and presentations provided that they are reproduced for a limited\nnumber of participants and not used commercially. This also applies to research essays.\nHowever, the use solely for illustration purposes is not permitted and always requires the\nconsent of the copyright holder.\nImages from social media are also protected by copyright. Pictures of people as well as of\nlandscapes from social media platforms are copyrighted and may only be used with per-\nmission. In the case of pictures in which people are depicted, in addition to the consent of\nthe author/photographer, the people depicted in the image themselves must also consent\nto their image being used. Such consent shall not be subject to any condition and must\ncontain detailed information on the data used, the purpose of the data used, the storage\nperiod of the data, and whether disclosure to third parties is planned. Due to the large\namount of information contained in such consent, it is imperative that it be obtained in\nwriting.\nScreenshots are also treated mostly like images where many of the same considerations\napply. It must serve to clarify the text and cannot be used simply as an \u201cinsignificant\naccessory\u201d . Screenshots of websites and videos are to be treated like image citations. In\naddition to the image citation, one should obtain the consent of the author or person\ndepicted.\nNon-Disclosure Agreements\nIn order to protect data and information when pursuing scientific work, there is the option\nto use a non-disclosure agreement. This is particularly helpful if a scientific paper is writ-\nten in cooperation with an external cooperation partner or with a company. Each study\ncan be provided with a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement. The latter stipulates\nthat the work\u2014without the express consent of the company and the author\u2014will not be\nmade available to third parties, with the exception of the supervising lecturers and author-\nized members of the audit committee. The non-disclosure agreement prohibits publica-\ntion for a specific period of time in an effort  to protect sensitive data and research results.\nAt the same time, the scientifically necessary publication of research results can be partly\ndelayed or completely prevented (if the results do not appear optimal), which repeatedly\nfuels criticism of privately financed research. Therefore, a compromise must always be\nfound between the interests of the company and the interests of the university or the sci-\nentific institution and community. Violation of a non-disclosure agreement may even\nresult in criminal prosecution.\nAffidavit\nAn affidavit  must be included in every academic work. With this declaration, the author\nconfirms that the work is independent and was not produced with outside help or through\nthe use of outside intellectual property. It is also confirmed that no sources other than\nthose stated were used. The affidavit  must be included in the work. It is not submitted as a\n36separate document but forms the last page of the written elaboration (after  the annexes).\nA missing or unsigned affidavit  leads to failure of the examination. Unlike many other uni-\nversities, the declaration at IU is filed electronically before submission. The declaration\ndoes not have to be included in the work itself (except for the thesis\u2014further information\nunder Information Thesis in General in myCampus).\nEXAMPLE AFFIDAVIT\nI hereby swear that I have done this work independently and without the use of\noutside help. The sources and tools I used are clearly marked as such and refer-\nenced at each instance in the text. This work has not yet been submitted in the\nsame or a similar form to any other examining authority. I agree that the work\nwill be checked for plagiarism with the help of a plagiarism detection service.\n______________________\nSignature\n2.4 Spelling and Format\nA research paper must meet certain formal criteria which serve to ensure legibility, trans-\nparency, understanding, and clarity (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 731\u2013739 ). The excessive use\nof personal pronouns as \u201cI\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d should be avoided in academic writing ( Saunders et\nal., 2019, p. 737). If the researcher takes an active part in the research process, moderate\nuse of personal pronouns could be reasonable. Language should be gender-neutral, non-\nbinary and not discriminating. More information is found in the IU guidelines for gender-\ninclusive/sensitive language available in myCampus.\nThe spelling (orthography) of each work should be adapted to meet the current standard\nand must be applied consistently. Spelling and typing errors should be avoided by reading\nthe work several times, and one can even use third-party reviewers, before submission.\nStudents whose native language is different  from the one used in the examination should\nhave their work proofread by a trained native user for the review of language, style, and\nunderstanding.\nThe paper is preceded by a title page on which the author (complete with name, postal\naddress, email address, and student number), corresponding event (course, lecturer,\nsemester, and title), and topic and type of work (written assignment, research essay, bach-\nelor thesis, etc.) are noted.\nApart from the title page, all pages must be numbered. The pages before the body of the\ntext (e.g., title page, table of contents, list of tables and abbreviations) should be num-\nbered in Roman capital letters (I, II, III, IV, etc.), with the page number not appearing on\npage I (title page). The pages of the text part are numbered with Arabic numbers (1, 2, 3,\n37etc.), beginning with page 1. This is usually the bullet point \u201c1 Introduction\u201d . These page\nnumbers are continued to the end, i.e., also through the appendix. The desired position of\nthe page numbers is centered at the end of the page. Further form specifications can be\nfound in the Exam Guide in myCampus for every type of examination.\nIdeally, illustrations and tables should be created by the author; previously created graph-\nics and images should only be used when absolutely necessary.\nImages, sound, and video material are subject to copyright and must be identified by cita-\ntions. Rules for correct citations are found in the general citation guidelines.\n2.5 Identification and Focus of Research\nTopics\nBefore a topic for a scientific paper is decided on and research is started, one should check\nwhether there are certain requirements for that topic area. This applies to all types of aca-\ndemic work.\nThe following questions should be answered \u201cyes\u201d if the topic is chosen freely.\n\u2022Is the subject interesting to me?\n\u2022Can I imagine dealing with the topic intensively for a while?\n\u2022Do I have previous knowledge of the chosen topic?\n\u2022Is the topic of interest important for my further studies and career goals?\n\u2022Does the topic meet the requirements in terms of scope?\nTopics which may prove unsuitable include those that\n\u2022have been extensively covered (\u201ctrending\u201d) and for which there is a wealth of existing\nliterature.\n\u2022represent a strong personal connection, such that scientific discussion and objectivity\nmight become difficult.\n\u2022are still explorative, i.e., for which there is little or no literature available.\n\u2022require the use of sources that are difficult  to find or completely unavailable.\n\u2022require the use of sources that are too demanding technically or linguistically (foreign\nlanguages).\n\u2022require the use of methods that are not mastered or are unavailable within the given\nframework.\n\u2022are too abstract, making a practical scientific approach difficult.\n\u2022require elaborate empirical approaches.\nIt is not always easy to answer these questions. For example, whether a topic is extensively\nresearched (or not sufficiently  researched) and unsuitable for one's own research work,\ndoes not necessarily become apparent after  the initial literature search. It is also not\nalways easy to recognize which methods are most suitable for dealing with a topic ( Saun-\n38ders et al., 2019, pp. 26\u201329). Ideally, interesting topics and questions arise continuously\nthroughout the studies. It would makes sense to solidify topic identification and avoid\nabstractions.\nOnce the working title of the topic is named, the research question to be answered is\nderived from it (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 42). Depending on the scope of the scientific\nwork, it is also common to formulate two or three research questions related to a topic.\nThese questions help narrow the topic and serve as a common thread throughout the\nwork, and also help with the preparation of the outline.\nThese are examples of poor titles:\n\u2022Leadership in the 21st Century\n\u2022Work 4.0\n\u2022Digitization in the World of Work\nThese are examples of better titles:\n\u2022The Model of Transformational Leadership in the Energy Industry: Innovation or Trend?\n\u2022Influence of Digitalization in the Service Industry Using the Example of Call Center Soft-\nware  in the Insurance Industry\n\u2022The Effect  of Digitalization on the Travel Behavior of Generation Z\u2014An Overview of Cur-\nrent Applications in the Tourism Industry\nUsing thematic boundaries and constraints can help to determine which aspects should\nbe addressed, which should not, and why. The following example considerations can be\nused as criteria to narrow the topic:\n\u2022time\n\u2022geography\n\u2022institutions\n\u2022groups of people\n\u2022sources\n\u2022people or authors\n\u2022aspects of a particular discipline\n\u2022theoretical approaches or explanatory concepts\n\u2022theoretical or explanatory approaches according to experts\n\u2022specific, selected aspects\n2.6 Research Question and Outline\nThe research question is an integral part of the outline of a scientific work and is embed-\nded in the introduction (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 714\u2013715). The entire outline must follow\na common thread, which develops according to the research question being asked. The\nfollowing image is that of a funnel. The research question in this case is the funnel (with\nbuilt-in filter), which decides the classification points and facts to be included. Everything\n39that can be processed within the outline of the work and contributes to the assessment of\nthe research question must be included. The outline should demonstrate how the\nresearch questions is executed. It must reflect a logical development of the work as well as\nprovide an overview of it.\nFigure 3: Funnel Function of a Research Question\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nExamples of research questions include the following:\n\u2022What influence does a manager's leadership style have on employee health?\n\u2022Which evidence-based models are available to application-oriented research on healthy\nleadership in companies?\n\u2022What research needs arise from the current state of research on healthy leadership?\nThese examples of research questions could all be chosen and developed under the title\n\u201cLeadership and Health\u2014A Challenge for the Mechanical Engineering Sector\u201d .\nOutline\nIn the outline, all outline points are listed, if necessary with sub-points. If a subdivision of\nan outline point is necessary, it must contain at least two sub-points.\nTable 2: Structure of a Scientific Outline\nPoor Better\n1. Introduction 1.

Theoretical Foundation\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nAs a rule, the work should be divided into a maximum of three section levels (1. Main\nHeading, 1.1 Section, 1.1.1 Subsection). The sections and subsections must be identical in\ntitle and numbering as those mentioned in the text. Because section headings, and the\ncorresponding page numbers, often  change during the course of writing, it is advisable to\nwork with corresponding font formats (Heading 1, 2, etc.) from the beginning and create\nan automated table of contents.\nThe following parts occur in every scientific paper:\n\u2022table of contents (outline with page numbers),\n\u2022text part (consisting of introduction, body and conclusion),\n\u2022bibliography.\nOther indexes, such as list of figures, list of tables, and list of abbreviations, help the read-\nership to find pertinent additional information. The lists of tables and figures as well as\nthe list of abbreviations are listed in the front part of the paper, i.e., between the table of\ncontents and the text part. A list of tables must be listed for three or more tables and a list\nof figures for three or more figures. Another optional part is the appendix. It serves to\npresent information that is too detailed for the text part, but important for its understand-\ning. This can be the original copy of a survey, large tables, or scanned materials and tran-\nscripts of in-depth interviews. Each appendix must be labeled as an \u201cAppendix\u201d with an\nappropriate label. For example: Appendix A, Appendix B, etc. Appendix pages are num-\nbered but are not included in the specified page count of an examination paper. Each\nappendix should be referenced in the paper.\nOnly the individual sections in the text of the paper are numbered in the outline; the other\noutline components of the paper, such as the table of figures or bibliography, are indica-\nted without numbering. The following basic outline must be taken into account for the\ntext part of a paper (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 714):\n\u2022introduction\n\u2022body (with theoretical background/literature review, methods, findings/results and dis-\ncussion)\n\u2022conclusion\nWhile it is common to include \u201cintroduction\u201d and \u201cconclusion\u201d as chapter titles, for the\nbody of text you need to choose chapter titles that are suited for your specific research\ntopic. However, it is important to internalize the basic structure of a scientific paper. Espe-\ncially the chapters, possibly with their subchapters, in the body must usually be adapted\nto the specific content. However, it is important to internalize the basic structure of a sci-\nentific paper.\n41In the introduction, the research question, objective, problem statement, and structure of\nthe work are described, and relevant and interesting facts are provided. It is here that you\nwant to take a look at what might motivate the reader to continue reading (Saunders et\nal., 2019, pp. 714\u2013715).\nThe theoretical background serves to classify the entire topic and research question into a\nscientific, evidence-based research context. It is important to present existing knowledge\nand its relevance to the research question (state of current research) (Saunders et al.,\n2019, p. 715). In this context, the stringing together of term definitions should be avoided.\nTherefore, instead of devoting an entire subsection to the definition of terms, these are\nexplained the first time they are mentioned in the text.\nTable 3: Structure of a Scientific Outline\nPoor Better\n2.

In the\nmethods section, the decision to use a certain methodology is explained in more detail.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of the chosen method must be critically considered\nand discussed (method criticism) (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 717). In this part of the paper,\nthe choosen method and its specific steps are described; e.g., if a systematic literature\nsearch was conducted or which empirical process was chosen (qualitative or quantitative).\nIn the findings/results section, the own results, which were generated with the applied\nmethod, are presented neutrally, i.e., without evaluation and interpretation. In literature-\nbased work, the results of the literature review are presented. If empirical methods are\nused, the results of the empirical investigation are presented in this part (Saunders et al.,\n2019, p. 718).\nThe discussion serves as the final reflection and comparison of the findings against the\nbackground of the current state of research, and, where appropriate, political or social\ndevelopments. Once again, one must reiterate the conclusions to the research question in\na relevant and lively way. It is also possible here to describe a model for best practice or to\nprovide recommendations for further action. The identification of further research can\nalso be part of this discussion (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 718\u2013719).\nFinally, the conclusion summarizes the entire paper and may also include the subjective\nopinion of the author (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 719\u2013720).\n42SUMMARY\nGood scientific practice places many demands on the author of a scien-\ntific work. This unit provides a complex profile of the requirements that\nstudents are advised to start dealing with at the beginning of their stud-\nies to achieve systematic success. Thus, questions of scientific integrity\nare not only important with regard to the recognition of one's work, but\nare also prerequisites for science. This is one of the reasons why affida-\nvits are required for scientific papers.\nFurthermore, when doing research and writing scientific papers, the\nexamination of data protection and copyright laws is relevant. However,\npragmatic guidelines on the structure, form, and outline of a scientific\nwork must also be understood in terms of their form and scope.\n43UNIT 3\nRESEARCH METHODS\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 the difference  between data collection and data analysis.\n\u2013 the essential characteristics of quantitative methods.\n\u2013 the essential characteristics of qualitative methods.\n\u2013 how to explain the quality criteria of research.3.RESEARCH METHODS\nCase Study\nIt's a week before the parliamentary elections. Simon and Maike are very interested in pol-\nitics and world affairs,  and both have been politically engaged for years, albeit with differ-\nent convictions and political orientations. This makes such political and historical events\nexciting for them both\u2014not to mention the rich discussions. One week before the big elec-\ntion, they watched a political debate on television. Directly after  the end of the broadcast,\na large opinion research institute conducted a survey on party preference (\u201cIf elections\nhappened today, which party would you vote for?\u201d). The moderator explains that 1,000\nrepresentative participants were surveyed by phone, and the result of the survey will be\nannounced on the next show.\nAccording to Simon, \u201cfacts\u201d , as presented by the opinion research institute, are unclear\nand imprecise in many respects and leave much room for interpretation. He explains to\nMaike that he can hardly believe that the representative sample of 1,000 people accurately\nreflects the electorate. He is curious on how the sample was selected and the ratios for\ngender, age ranges, and educational backgrounds. From his own professional experience,\nhe knows how difficult  it can be to reach target groups for opinion research. In addition,\nSimon raises other questions: Were both voters and non-voters really questioned here?\nHow meaningful is such a hypothetical question in the context of a quantitative survey?\nWould it have made more sense to supplement the survey with an open question on the\nreasons, i.e., to combine quantitative with qualitative methods? These many questions\nresult in Simon and Maike having an in-depth discussion on empirical research and the\nassociated instruments that lasts long into the night. Seeing how close one's own life is to\napplication-oriented research is quite exciting.\n3.1 Empirical Research\nWhen doing research, a wide variety of methods are used (Veal, 2018, p. 132). Depending\non the research objective and the underlying research paradigm, qualitative methods or\nquantitative methods can be used (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 175\u2013178). It is also possible\nto choose a mixture of qualitative and quantitative approaches, often  referred to as meth-\nodological triangulation ( Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 181\u2013184). Since qualitative and quanti-\ntative research methods have specific advantages and disadvantages, triangulation often\nserves to compensate for the disadvantages of the respective methodology and should\nthus lead to a more meaningful research result.\nWhen considering the different  methodological approaches, it is important to distinguish\nbetween data collection and data analysis (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 176\u2013180 , Veal, 2018,\np. 47). Data collection has the purpose of generating the necessary data. Data analysis\naims to evaluate the available data, which can then be interpreted accordingly. Since the\nvarious research methods have both advantages and disadvantages, it is important to\n46think about the quality of an investigation. For this purpose, scientific quality criteria are\nused, which differ  according to the type of research (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 213\u2013219 ).\nThese quality criteria not only point to the research quality achieved, but also show the\nextent to which researchers are able to critically reflect on their own approach.\nWhen thinking about the opinion poll discussed above, it is obvious that quantitative\nresearch was carried out because the result is based on figures and shows percentages.\nMoreover, they used a representative sample, although no details are presented that allow\nto assess the degree of representativeness. The survey was conducted by phone, although\nit is not known whether landlines, mobile numbers, or both, were included. Furthermore,\ndata analysis has been carried out in a simple statistical way\u2014also referred to as descrip-\ntive statistics. With regard to research quality, it could be noted that in the phone surveys\nthe interviewer could have an influence on the results through his or her way of speaking\nor questioning. For some participants it might be embarrassing to reveal their political\npreference in a phone survey. Finally, the question could be raised as to whether calling\nlate on a Sunday evening might falsify the results, especially since it remains unclear\nwhether or not only landlines and/or mobile numbers were called. With landlines, for\nexample, the problem is that only a few young people still have them, and that it is more\nlikely that they are out on a Sunday evening rather than at home in front of the TV. A criti-\ncal attitude toward research questions and their implementation is an essential prerequi-\nsite for good empirical research.\n3.2 Literature Reviews\nNot all academic papers present findings from empirical findings; it is also possible to do a\nliterature review (G\u00fclpinar & G\u00fccl\u00fc, 2013, p. 44), i.e., summarizing relevant literature and\nnot conducting a survey, experiment, etc. This means that neither quantitative nor quali-\ntative research methods, nor methodological triangulation are used. Literature reviews\ncomprise a theoretical overview that compiles and evaluates the current state of research\ninto specific research questions, i.e., summarizing research results. These papers, written\nin the style of a review, are known as quality standards in evidence-based research.\nThe purpose of a literature review is to present and assess the existing knowledge on a\nspecific topic in a concise way (G\u00fclpinar & G\u00fccl\u00fc, 2013, p. 44). To this end, relevant litera-\nture must first be selected, grouped, systematically processed, analyzed, and critically\nevaluated. A review is therefore more than a series of summaries of different  sources. A\nliterature review is also based on a research question. How many studies and literature\nsources are needed to write a good literature review cannot be answered in general terms.\nAs a rule, a literature review, similar to an empirical paper, is divided into an introduction,\na body (with theoretical foundation, method part, results of the literature search, discus-\nsion) and a final part, the conclusion. Due to the abundance of articles, it is particularly\nimportant to clearly document the selection process of studies and literature used. Select-\ning relevant literature is essential for writing a good literature review; therefore, one needs\nto specify exactly how the search was carried out (G\u00fclpinar & G\u00fcclu, 2013, p. 47; Hiebl,\n2021, p. 6).\n47\u2022Which databases were searched?\n\u2022Which keywords were used for the search, and in what form?\n\u2022According to what criteria were the sources included or excluded?\n\u2022How many sources and literature have been included in the literature survey?\nThese questions are answered in the methods part of the literature review. For a better\noverview of the selected literature, a table can be helpful which can also be helpful when\ndescribing the results.\nTable 4: Example of a Table Providing an Overview of Sources\nSource 1 Source 2 Source 3\nQuestion\nResearch Subject / Foundational\nData\nTheoretical Foundation, Models,\nConcepts\nMethodical Approach\nImportant Results / Response to\nthe Research Question\nOther\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\n3.3 Quantitative Data Collection\nWhen looking at data collection methods in quantitative research, the following methods\ncome into particular consideration (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 178):\n\u2022experiments\n\u2022surveys\n\u2022observations\n\u2022content analyses\nAll procedures must lead to number-based data (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 178). In addition\nto scientific experiments, surveys are one of the most frequently used methods of quanti-\ntative data collection (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 178). Surveys can be carried out both orally\nand in writing, whereby the written survey has the advantage that researchers have no\nindividual influence on the results, since they do not come into personal contact with the\ninterviewees (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 193\u2013196). In addition, written surveys offer  the\ngreat advantage that very large amounts of data can be processed. In quantitative studies,\nstandardized questionnaires are most frequently used, allowing the participant to choose\n48from multiple choice answers. Oral surveys are also used in quantitative data collection\nwith one example being election surveys by phone, which aim to collect data as quickly as\npossible.\nObservations are often  used to count certain behavior patterns (Veal, 2018, p. 253). One\nexample would be to observe and count how often  consumers with small children buy a\nchocolate bar at the supermarket checkout. Thus, conclusions can be drawn from the\nobserved frequency of certain behavior patterns, for example on the best possible presen-\ntation of merchandise in the supermarket. Text analyses are used in quantitative data col-\nlection, for example, to count certain words or word groups from a text. One could, for\nexample, find out how often  tabloid newspapers use certain dramatic adjectives in their\nnewspaper articles and whether, and to what extent, this number differs  from the one in\ntraditional print media. Content analyses also offer  the great advantage that very large\namounts of data can be collected and processed later on.\nData analysis then focuses on processing the collected, number-based data ( Saunders et\nal., 2019, p. 564). The analytical methods of quantitative research are often  differentiated\naccording to the number of variables used ( Cleff,  2019, p. 5). If one variable is taken into\naccount, then it is called univariate analysis method. If, for example, you want to know\nhow salary levels behave in a company, you could determine the average, median, and\ncertain distributions.\nIf the relationship between two variables is of interest, then the bivariate analysis proce-\ndure applies, and if more than two variables are considered, the quantitative data analysis\nprocedures are called multivariate ( Cleff,  2019, p. 5). A bivariate data analysis is used to\ntest if, for example, the number of overtime hours worked and the number of sick days in a\ncompany are related. A multivariat analysis can, for example, determine which variables\naffect  the choice of equipment package when buying a car; here variables such as age,\nincome, or gender could be taken into account.\n3.4 Qualitative Data Collection\nQualitative research methodology requires a close look at data collection. In general,\nqualitative research is characterized by the collection and analysis of text-based data\n(Saunders et al., 2019, p. 179). In this respect, the collection of data is mainly concerned\nwith spoken or written texts. Likewise, it can deal with symbols, observations, or artifacts,\nas long as these are somehow expressed textually. Qualitative data can, e.g., be collected\nwith the following techniques (Veal, 2018, pp. 136, 286; Saunders, et al., 2019, p. 180):\n\u2022interviews\n\u2022observations\n\u2022text analyses\nData collection usually takes place in conversations. These can be individual interviews,\nexpert discussions, or group interviews in which the conversations are either open or\nsemi-structured, meaning that the researcher orients his or her questions to a question-\n49naire (guideline) (Veal, 2018, pp. 136, 286). In open conversations, the researcher does not\nuse an interview guide, but conducts a conversation on a topic in which both the inter-\nviewer and the interviewee express themselves freely. Observations are often  made in\nrelation to behavioral patterns, which in turn include conversational situations. Text anal-\nysis refers to the interpretation of documents. The subjectivity of the researcher is an inte-\ngral part of the research process in qualitative research methodology and it is obvious that\ndata collection can be much deeper than is typical in quantitative research. It should also\nbe emphasized that the researcher may ask if an interviewee does not seem to have fully\nunderstood a question or if the interview results reveal interesting aspects that need to be\nexplored further. Qualitative data collection often  takes place \u201cin the field\u201d , for example\nwhere the interviewees work. Qualitative data collection is more likely to be applied to rel-\natively small samples because otherwise it would result in large amount of text-based\ndata, making the effort  of analysis enormously time-consuming.\nData analysis in qualitative research regularly consists of the interpretational processing\nof the obtained, text-based data. Different  methods are used for this purpose, which will\nnot be presented in detail here, however, the qualitative data analysis methods of Mayring\n(2000, 2022) and Kuckartz (2014) are resources worth exploring.\nIt is important for qualitative data analysis to be carried out in a rule-based and compre-\nhensible way. Software  is now also available for this purpose, which considerably simpli-\nfies the analysis of large text files (Veal, 2018, p. 465). The general aim of data analysis is to\nclassify interview statements (or fragments) into either a given category system or a cate-\ngory system developed from the data itself (Mayring, 2000). For example, employees from\ndifferent  sectors could be asked about their attitudes to certain motivational stimuli.\nBased on interpretations of interview statements it can be concluded, for example, that it\nis essentially non-material incentives (e.g., praise, recognition, opportunities for further\ndevelopment) that particularly motivate employees. After  these categories have been\ndeveloped from the analysis of the first interviews, one can check throughout the study\nwhether these categories continue to be confirmed by other interviewees or whether\nthere are more categories to add or a need to modify the existing categories resulting from\nthe interviews. In contrast to quantitative analysis where the response categories are\ndefined in advance, the development of categories in qualitative research is a continuous\nactivity carried out through the end of the interpretation process and is continuously\nadapted, if necessary.\n3.5 Mix of Methods\nThere are ongoing discussions about which of the methods\u2014qualitative or quantitative\u2014\nis better (Veal, 2018, pp. 43\u201344). Quantitative research typically offers  a mathematically\ncorrect, and therefore understandable, results (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 175). In addition,\nthe aspect of representativeness plays an important role because results in quantitative\nstudies can often  be generalized, which proves advantageous (Veal, 2018, p. 53 ). Recalling\nthe example of representative election research, it not only provides a fairly accurate pic-\nture of party preference in the population, but it is also used to forecast election results.\n50Qualitative research, on the other hand, can be used to more deeply research subject mat-\nter and to identify preferences, motives, attitudes, and perspectives ( Saunders et al., 2019,\npp. 175, 179). In this respect, quantitative investigations are often  said to be only mathe-\nmatically correct and therefore remain somewhat superficial (Guba & Lincoln, 1994, pp.\n105\u2013106 ). Here the question is often  asked whether, and to what extent, it is possible to\nrepresent complex human actions in a mathematical formula. On the other hand, qualita-\ntive research is often  said to produce only anecdotal evidence, i.e., to present little more\nthan \u201ctelling stories\u201d . Often,  qualitative research is even denied scientific merit.\nAn important difference  between the two basic approaches is that quantitative research is\nused to test and either confirm (verify) or disprove (falsify) existing theories. Qualitative\nmethods serve more to develop new theories and are thus typically used in fields in which\nlittle research has been done (explorative settings) and in which there are few existing the-\noretical approaches (Veal, 2018, pp. 135\u2013136).\nIt becomes clear that there is no one correct method, but that both methodological\napproaches have their advantages in certain thematic areas and research questions ( Bell,\n2018, pp. 25\u201326). Therefore, a widely shared opinion has been established that the two\nmethodologies do not, in fact, contradict each other, but are ideally even used in combina-\ntion, which happens, for example, in student evaluations or in service satisfaction studies.\nVery often  the participants are first guided through a standardized questionnaire with cer-\ntain checkbox options. This is the quantitative part of the study. In addition, the partici-\npants often  get the opportunity to express in writing their personal opinion in an open text\nbox, which is the qualitative part of the investigation. This mix of methods is also called\ntriangulation and offers  enormous research advantages (Veal, 2018, pp. 157\u2013158). First,\nthe advantages of both methods are combined and at the same time their disadvantages\nare balanced. Second, the research result is particularly valuable. While the quantitative\npart offers  generalizable preferences of the study participants, the qualitative part pro-\nvides further, usually more in-depth, information, which likely was not addressed in the\nquantitative survey.\n3.6 Critique of Methods and Self-\nReflection\nResearch and the results it produces must be justified in terms of quality (Saunders et al.,\n2019, p. 213). Different  quality criteria are used for qualitative and quantitative research\nmethods in order to critically reflect on the quality of the research carried out. The fact\nthat different  standards are applied here is due to the various objectives pursued in the\ntwo research approaches. Therefore, a comprehensive critique of the methodology is nec-\nessary for many academic papers. It shows the researchers\u2019 degree of self-reflection and\nalso provides information on what the results can be used for and where their limits lie.\nIn quantitative research one of the most important questions is whether results generated\nin a sample are generalizable or representative of the population as a whole ( Veal, 2018, p.\n53). So if 1,000 eligible voters are questioned about their party preference, is the result\n51Representativeness\nIf the result of research\ncompleted from a sample\nprovides a viable picture\nof the characteristics of\nthe general population, it\nis considered representa-\ntive.\nValidity\nWhen an investigation\nmeasures what it is sup-\nposed to measure, the\ninvestigation results are\nvalid.\nReliability\nWhen the results of an\ninvestigation are replica-\nble, they are said to be\nreliable.\nObjectivity\nFor the results of an\ninvestigation to be objec-\ntive, they should be inde-\npendent of the respective\nresearcher.\nSaturation\nIn data collection, satura-\ntion is said to have been\nachieved if no new find-\nings are generated\ndespite the inclusion of\nnew data.then generalizable, i.e., valid for the entire electorate? Representativeness  means that\nthe result of research completed from a sample provides a viable picture of the character-\nistics of the population. Representativeness is ensured by the type of sample selection\nand can, depending on the type of population, be statistically represented. In this context,\nit is important to note that not every quantitative study needs to be representative in\norder to be valuable. As is the case in many final university exams, a representative sam-\nple is not always possible due to time constraints. This does not mean that the investiga-\ntion is worthless; it only means that there are uncertain conclusions about the population.\nFurthermore, the quality of a quantitative study is expressed by the aspects of validity,\nreliability, and objectivity (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 213\u2013214, 268). Validity  means that\nthe results obtained reflect exactly what one wanted to investigate. One could, for exam-\nple, ask whether the measurement of voting intentions actually reflects election behavior.\nIt could be that the respondents, out of general rage, indicate protest parties as election\npreferences in the survey, but then choose the established parties in the election. Relia-\nbility  refers to the question of whether one would come to the same results if the investi-\ngation was repeated under the same conditions. Objectivity  requires the researcher to\nhave a negligible influence on the processes of data collection and analysis. Electoral\nresearch, for example, often  uses phone interviews. This procedure reduces the quality\ncriterion of objectivity because the nature of the question could influence the interviewee.\nAn exception of this quality criterion is accepted, however, in order to have results availa-\nble quickly\u2014an aspect that is naturally important before elections.\nIn qualitative research, other quality criteria are applied (Saunders et al., 2019, p. 216 ).\nWith relatively small samples, representativeness would certainly not be possible and\ndoes not represent the goal of qualitative research. Rather, saturation  is the aim ( Saun-\nders et al., 2018). Saturation is the point at which no new findings arise despite the inclu-\nsion of further data records (e.g., further interviews). Even in qualitative research, not\nevery investigation can guarantee saturation. Twenty-five long interviews can quickly lead\nto the creation of several hundred pages of transcripts. It would not be possible to evalu-\nate this completely in a bachelor or master thesis due to time constraints. Nevertheless,\neven a non-saturated qualitative study can reveal valuable tendencies.\nFurther quality criteria for qualitative research are dependability, credibility, and transfer-\nability ( Lincoln & Guba, 1985  as cited in Saunders et al., 2019, p. 217). Dependability refers\nto the question of whether data have been evaluated consistently, accurately, and without\ncontradiction. This is ensured by correspondingly clear interpretation rules. In qualitative\nresearch, credibility is established by an interpretation process guided by rules in which\nthe results can be checked at any time using the interpretation rules. The transferability\ncan be achieved, for example, by having several researchers evaluate the data and thereby\ndetermine the intersections and discrepancies. Where interpretations are congruent, a\ngreater degree of transferability can be assumed.\nIt is important to describe which quality criteria can be achieved or ensured to what\ndegree for both method criticism and critical reflection in academic work. Any limitations\n\u2014which are often  understandable and acceptable\u2014should also be pointed out. Limita-\ntions often  result in further research paths that can be pursued in the future. This is a nor-\nmal and desirable process, since research truly never ends.\n52SUMMARY\nResearchers should always apply and consider the critical examination\nof research findings in their practice because it is a core competence.\nQuestioning and reflecting on study designs, surveys, presentations of\nresults, and individual research instruments or methods represent exis-\ntential components in a holistic research process. In order to be able to\nmake these assessments and reflections, it is indispensable to have\nsound basic knowledge of quantitative, qualitative, and triangulated\nresearch methodologies in order to be able to classify and evaluate the\nquality of research processes.\n53UNIT 4\nACADEMIC ADMINISTRATION: STRUCTURE,\nAPPLICATION, AND LITERATURE\nMANAGEMENT\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 what plagiarism is and how to avoid it in academic writing.\n\u2013 why and how you should use research databases.\n\u2013 which search techniques and keyword searches are optimal for your research question.\n\u2013how to reference and cite sources and how to apply academic guidelines in authoring\nyour work.\n\u2013 what a literature management program can do.\n\u2013 how to create a bibliography with the help of a literature management program.\n\u2013which software  and application tools IU offers  to support the writing of academic\npapers.4.ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATION:\nSTRUCTURE, APPLICATION, AND\nLITERATURE MANAGEMENT\nCase Study\nTo work on his bachelor thesis, Simon has registered as an external student at a university\nwhere he can use the library at any time and have access to the academic community and\nits publications on-site via PCs and virtual catalogs. This is the ideal complement to the IU\nonline search portal. Today, he is mainly looking for basic literature and high-quality sys-\ntematic reviews that address his research question. In his work, Simon wants to examine\nwhy potential customers of a newly-introduced product had no interest in purchasing it,\ncausing the product to flop. His research questions are as follows: (1) Which factors have a\npositive as well as a negative effect  on the purchasing decisions of young target groups of?\n(2) How can these findings be applied to the marketing campaign of a product relaunch?\nTo begin with, Simon develops a search strategy and works on a keyword search in his pri-\nmary language as well as in English in order to find international literature in the databa-\nses. Before turning to online databases, he first finds three particularly up-to-date and\nsuitable books in the library catalog. In the course of his research in the online databases\nit quickly became clear to him that it is important to carefully sort and archive all relevant\nliterature in order to be able to efficiently  access it later. Therefore, he downloads a litera-\nture management program to his computer, where his sources can be stored and accessed\nwith keywords and other aids. Whenever a source is placed in the text, the program helps\nto format it in the required citation style. Simon gladly takes the time to properly enter the\nliterature into the software  because he knows how important accuracy is so that his own\nbachelor thesis remains free of errors and plagiarism, i.e., the unfair use of other people's\nintellectual property.\nThe handling of literature and sources is a special focus of academic writing. The following\ncontents on plagiarism prevention, database search, search strategies and techniques, lit-\nerature management, citation and writing guidelines, as well as the bibliography, apply to\nall IU-specific examination formats. This means that they apply to written assignments\nand research essays, project reports, case studies, portfolios, bachelor theses, colloquia,\nand presentations, if applicable. When writing papers at IU, always consult the updated\nguidelines of the respective courses.\n4.1 Plagiarism Prevention\nAnyone starting to write an academic paper needs to have comprehensive literature on\nthe subject and adequate access to the internet and academic databases. In today's\nknowledge-based service society, this is hardly a problem. However, students are faced\nwith the challenge of correctly selecting, processing, qualitatively assessing, systematiz-\n56Turnitin\nThis is the plagiarism\ndetection software  used\nby IU.ing, and evaluating the many approaches to finding relevant literature sources. In many of\nthese freely accessible academic texts, however, authorship is often  not clearly recogniza-\nble. All the greater is the danger of not respecting the intellectual property of others, since\nthe limits of \u201cyours\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d are less respected due to the low threshold of access\n(Saunders et al., 2019, p. 115). A university, therefore, has the responsibility to counteract\nthis and develop measures to maintain academic integrity. For this reason, it is important\nto implement the rules of good academic writing from the start. Plagiarism problems can\nbe avoided. The first part of this unit focuses on raising awareness of this problem in order\nto prevent any plagiarism from happening in the long run.\nWhat is Plagiarism?\nThe University of Oxford (2022) defines plagiarism as, \u201cthe copying or paraphrasing of\nother people's work or ideas into your own work without full acknowledgment. All pub-\nlished and unpublished material, whether in manuscript, printed or electronic form, is\ncovered by this definition. 'Collusion' is another form of plagiarism involving the unau-\nthorised collaboration of students or other individuals in a piece of work\u201d .\nIn the case of plagiarism, a distinction must be made between the various types of plagia-\nrism, e.g., adopting text passages from other authors and others\u2019 ideas, adopting one's\nown already published ideas (University of Oxford, 2022; Folt\u00fdnek et al., 2020, p. 15).\nAccording to Folt\u00fdnek et al. (2020, p. 15) plagiarism typically includes:\n\u2022the use of someone else\u2019s findings and their presentation as the author\u2019s own findings,\n\u2022translation or paraphrase of another work and its presentation as an original work,\n\u2022undeclared use of own, formerly published work (self-plagiarism),\n\u2022incorrect citations and source referencing,\n\u2022undeclared contributions to the work presented,\n\u2022undeclared authorship of another person (contract cheating).\nMeasures and Consequences\nThe increased digital availability of academic texts brings with it some dangers, e.g.,\nunidentified authorships and the associated increase in plagiarism. In contrast, however,\nthere are also certain advantages that arise from this change because technology signifi-\ncantly increases the possibility of detecting plagiarism. Therefore, many universities now\nrely on plagiarism software  and possible sanctions. IU currently uses the plagiarism detec-\ntion software  Turnitin  to check all submitted work. Only after  this check the examiner is\nabl to make a final assessment. If the rules of academic work are violated in the form of a\ndetected plagiarism, under the General Examination Regulations (APO) this is treated as\nan attempt to deceive. In this case, the examination performance is assessed as \u201cunsatis-\nfactory\u201d and is failed.\n574.2 Database Search\nThe search for information is a big part of the university degree program. Many sources of\ninformation are easily found on the internet, while other sources require a more elaborate\nsearch which should be carried out as systematically as possible (see Bramer et al., 2018 ,\nfor an introduction to this topic). Depending on the resource, there are different  ways to\naccess different  sources. Naturally, the quality of the results found also varies.\nFor a first search for identifying relevant literature, the resources of the university library\nwith its range of catalogs and databases should be used (Oliver, 2012, p. 53 ). So-called dis-\ncovery systems make it possible to search in different  sources s at the same time.\nWhile general online search is usually possible without access restrictions, the use of data-\nbases and library catalogs is sometimes reserved for a limited number of users or is only\npossible for a fee. As a rule, educational and research institutions hold licenses for rele-\nvant databases so that authorized persons can use them free of charge (Saunders et al.,\n2019, pp. 94\u201395). IU holds licenses for some important databases such as ScienceDirect,\nWISOnet, EBSCO, and Statista.\nTable 5: Important IU Databases/Search Engines\nBASE Search Engine Special search engine of the University of Bielefeld, interdisciplinary\nECONBiz Research portal for economics, including filter function for full texts,\narticles from professional, subject-specific journals, working papers\n(open access), books, and essays\nGoogle Scholar Special search engine by Google, advanced searches possible and\nreferences displayed, i.e., the number of documents that have been\nquoted in an article: allows conclusions to be drawn about the qual-\nity of the article\nKarlsruhe Virtual Catalog (KVK) Metacatalog which simultaneously searches libraries, bookstores,\nand electronic sources; good to use for an initial overview of the\ntopic\nOpen-Access.net Freely accessible sources organized according to subject, e.g. eco-\nnomics, business, psychology\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nLibrary catalogs normally contain books and periodicals that are available. Some journal\narticles are also included. This type of entry can be extensive, for example, with assign-\nment of content-describing keywords, sometimes tables of contents are included. Con-\ntents of databases can be quite multifaceted\u2014sometimes you can search full texts of jour-\nnal articles, press contents, e-books, statistics, company information, and personal\ninformation, while other times you only get references to the publications. In most cases,\nthematic distinctions are present in the databases.\n58Search Technique\nDatabases (and general search engines) require their own search language. The simplest\nversions should be intuitive for all users (Bramer et al., 2018, p. 536).\nA search term is entered into a search field and then the search is carried out by confirma-\ntion (\u201cSearch\u201d , \u201cOK\u201d , or a search symbol). In addition to this Basic Search, Advanced\nSearch also exists in many systems. Here, it is possible to combine search terms and per-\nhaps search in special search fields.\nFigure 4: Basic Search Engine Fields, EBSCO Discovery Service IU\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nFigure 5: Advanced Search Engine Fields, EBSCO Discovery Service IU\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nIn many databases, operators can be used for the search; for example, the Boolean search\noperators AND, OR, and NOT (Bramer et al., 2018, p. 536). The following illustrations\nexplain the respective effects  (the area that is captured is shaded).\n59Figure 6: Search Operator AND\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nThe result of the search with Europe AND Germany contains the intersection of the search\nterms. Both search terms appear in every result.\nFigure 7: Search Operator OR\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nThe result of the search for Behavior OR Behaviour contains the total number of these\nsearch terms. Both of the search terms appear in the list of results. This operator is useful\nfor synonyms and terms with different  spellings.\n60Figure 8: Search Operator NOT\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nThe result of Europe NOT Germany is an exclusion search. The first term should appear in\nthe results list, the second term should not. This shortens the list.\nTruncations can replace individual characters or parts of words (Bramer et. al, 2018, pp.\n534\u2014535 ), for example, a search with \u201ceurop*\u201d results in hits that contain the search term\nEuropa , Europe , or also European. The * replaces any character set. A special form of trun-\ncation is called masking. Here a wildcard replaces only one character within a search term,\ne.g., \u201cMa?er\u201d finds Maier and also Mayer. The characters used for truncation can be found\nin the help sections of the databases.\nFor many databases and search engines, the use of \u201c\u201d (quotation marks) is also regarded\nas activation of the phrase search. With the phrase search, you can ideally search for spe-\ncific titles or quotations, since the search terms should occur in the order given and with\nthe exact spacing specified.\nDiscovery systems also have another way to optimize results: lists can be reduced using\nthe filter or faceting options. This can include content (\u201csubject\u201d) or formal criteria (year of\npublication, media type, etc.).\n61Figure 9: Filter and Faceting Options (left  column) in IU EBSCO Discovery Service\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nKeep in mind that not all search operators are used equally in all search engines or data-\nbases. In addition, there are sometimes other operators or search options. Detailed infor-\nmation about which search operators can be used can be found in the help function or\nFAQ list of the application.\nSearch Strategies\nThe process of literature search can be divided in four main steps (Ecker & Skelly, 2010):\n1. First step: Formulate an answerable question.\n2. Second step: Choose a database, e.g. the Online-Library of Library and Information\nServices (LIS) or maybe other databases related to the field of study or interest.\n3. Third step: Type a word or phrase into the query box.\n4. Fourth step: Refine the search.\nAccording to Ecker and Skelly (2010) there are several techniques for refining the search:\n1. Replacing general terms with more specific terms\n2. Adding terms or combining terms with Boolean operators\n3. Using truncate terms or wildcard\n4. Use \u201climit\u201d-Options in the database (e.g., publishing year, language or publication\ntype)\n62If there is the case, that only a small number of hits is displayed or the literature is not\nappropriate to answer the question, than it is useful to generalize the search terms or use\nother search terms.\nAnother useful strategy to find literature is the snowball search (Florida Atlantic University,\n2022 ). This technique can be used, if one or more relevant sources (e.g., article or book)\nare already known. This source is used as the starting point to search for additional rele-\nvant literature. The search results in literature that listed this source in its bibliography\n(forward search or citing articles) or the entries from the reference list of this source (back-\nward search or cited articles). In addition, this search strategy allows for a search with key-\nwords from the relevant literature source.\nA search strategy that combines different  approaches is optimal. It is also helpful to docu-\nment the performed search steps including the search terms used.\nFinding Search Terms\nThe result of a search, and thus the academic quality of the literature selection, is essen-\ntially determined by the search terms used. There are various techniques that are helpfull\nto find search terms:\n\u2022Turning the topic into keywords assist in finding search terms (Walden University, 2021).\n\u2022Using synonyms, antonyms and abbreviations for a term/word (Walden University,\n2021 ). Also taking into account different  ways of writing or differences  between British\nand American English (organisation vs. organization or colour vs. color) ( Oulun Ylio-\npisto, 2022).\n\u2022Thesauri are controlled technical vocabulary created by experts that gives inspiration to\nsynonyms, related terms, narrower and/or broader terms (Bramer et al., 2018, pp. 533\u2013\n534). Thesauri are freely available on the internet, but some are also integrated into\ndatabases.\n\u2022Keywords can provide ideas for further search terms if relevant literature has already\nbeen found (Florida Atlantic University, n.d.).\nAs a final recommendation for the literature search, it should be mentioned that in search\nengines or databases there is usually always \u201csomething\u201d to find, even if it requires a cer-\ntain level of skill and amount of practice to determine the sources. It can be helpful to con-\nsult with your academic supervisors about what standard research exists in order to get a\nsubstantive introduction to your respective topic before proceeding. It is also important to\ntry out the individual resources, to continually improve the search strategy, to refine it\nwith other search terms, and, if necessary, to get help from the database providers or the\nLibrary and Information Services (LIS) Team at IU.\nEvaluation of Results\nAll sources that are to be included in an academic paper should first be scanned for cer-\ntain quality characteristics. Only academic and thematically-appropriate current literature\nshould be used. The CRAAP Test  can help verify identified sources (Meriam Library at Cali-\nfornia State University Chico, 2010):\n63\u2022Currency: Is the information up-to-date?\n\u2022Relevance: Is the information important for my question?\n\u2022Authority: Who/what is the source of information?\n\u2022Accuracy: Has the information been checked for accuracy?\n\u2022Purpose: What was the purpose of the information?\nThese criteria make it relatively easy to identify completely inappropriate publications.\nThe IU Library also offers  helpful introductory sessions on database search.\n4.3 Literature Management\nDuring all phases of academic work (e.g., in finding and assigning topics, obtaining and\nprocessing information, producing texts, or publishing) one is confronted with literature in\ndifferent  formats: books, chapters from books, journal articles, working papers, case stud-\nies, etc. (Saunders et al., 2019, pp. 83\u201390).\nSo that all this literature is accessible at any given time (e.g., before exams or when writing\na research essay or final thesis) and is both organized and easily accessible, it is best to\nstart thinking about how to manage it from the start and create a storage system that\nallows adding throughout the writing process (Fenner et al., 2014, p. 126).\nOptimal literature management begins by recording relevant literature (references). In\naddition to the traditional index card system, there are various software  solutions ( Fenner\net al., 2014, pp. 122\u2013136), whereby the format for documentation is usually predefined.\nSince there are different  permitted citation styles, the user can chose from a selection list\nor specifically create one. In many programs, one can differentiate  the references by\nmedia type and sort them by topic using the folder function. During the writing phase, the\npreviously-entered references can be accessed at any time. For citations, the correspond-\ning source is selected, which is then automatically integrated into the text in the selected\ncitation format. Depending on the citation style chosen, a bibliography in that style is usu-\nally created at the end of the document.\nUsing the word-processing program MS Word as an example, the process is described\nhere. Please note that depending on the version of Word, menu items and individual steps\nvary. Under the tab \u201cReferences\u201d you will find the menu item \u201cManage Sources\u201d or \u201cInsert\nQuotation\u201d . Entries into your personal bibliography can be made here.\nWhen writing the actual text\u2014depending on the version\u2014the desired entry is selected\nfrom the data pool by selecting the \u201cReferences\u201d tab and the menu item \u201cInsert Quote\u201d or\n\u201cQuotes\u201d . The citation style can be adjusted at any time via a selection list, e.g., here in\nAPA citation format:\nThis is the text I am referencing (McGill, 2025, p. 7).\n64All works cited in the text can automatically be listed in a bibliography at the end. The\n\u201cReferences\u201d tab and the \u201cBibliography\u201d menu item activate the bibliography in the\ndesired format. It can be updated at any time and is a great help especially for longer texts\nthat have been revised more frequently.\nExternal literature management programs (reference management software)  usually offer\nadditional functions (Fenner et al., 2014, pp. 126\u2013127). The possibility of transferring liter-\nature sources directly from literature databases into the software  is noteworthy, making it\nno longer necessary to enter the title information manually.\nThere are many reference management software  systems such as Bibsonomy, Citavi, Cit-\neULike, EndNote, Mendeley, Papers, Reference Manager, RefWorks, or Zotero. Some of\nthese programs are free; others have to be licensed for a fee. Some are user-friendly and\nefficient  while others require more training, but these usually have more functions ( Ivey &\nCrum, 2018; Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek (Technical University of\nMunich University Library, 2020). Generally, the software  can be downloaded and installed\non the computer, or used on a web interface when internet access is available. Some pro-\ngrams also offer  tools for collaboration, such as when sharing sources in a group project.\nMost programs work with Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browsers.\nAt IU, students and employees get a campus license for \u201cCitavi for Windows\u201d . Furthermore,\nthe Library and Information Services also offer  trainings and consulting services for the\nfree reference management software  Zotero. More information about the software  and the\nCitavi license can be found in the Library and Information Services course.\nThe \u201ctraditional\u201d literature management practice of copy-and-pasting one\u2019s literature list\ninto the respective document is also possible. There is no obligation to use literature man-\nagement software,  but it can make working with academic sources much easier, especially\nin the case of more extensive projects.\nThe decision for a suitable external literature management program depends on various\ncriteria, such as cost, technical capabilities (hardware or software  compatibility), func-\ntions, and user-friendliness. Some questions can easily be answered with software  com-\nparisons, while others can only be answered by trying.\nNote: A literature management program cannot take the place of evaluating the quality or\nrelevance of a source!\nMoreover, the use of a reference management program is no guarantee that all relevant\ninformation from a source will always be automatically and correctly transfered. There-\nfore, it is advisable to also check quotations and bibliographies manually at the end.\n654.4 Citation and Writing Guidelines\nIn general, you must acknowledge the use of the intellectual property of others (words or\nideas). In all of your academic papers, you must indicate each source and its location.\nReaders should be able to check each of your sources and to find the cited text passages.\nWithin the text, citations are written in an abbreviated form. Citations for quotations and\nparaphrases include the last name of the author(s), the year of publication and the page\nnumber. In some types of sources there is no page number. For an audio book, a time\nstamp is provided, or for an eBook in EPUB format, a chapter is provided. In indirect quo-\ntations that do not refer to a particular spot in a text, only the last name of the author(s)\nand the year of publication are provided.\nYou should always provide the name of the author in a citation. If your citation comes\nfrom two or more pages (e.g. pp. 24 and 25) provide the first and the last page (e.g. pp. 24\u2013\n25).\nTo maintain the flow of the text, you can use footnotes to indicate side notes or explana-\ntions that are not immediately relevant to the text. Footnotes are also appropriate for\ntranslations of quotations from languages other than English or references to copyright.\nFootnotes are found at the bottom of the relevant page after  the last period. They are indi-\ncated with a superscript in the text and are numbered throughout the whole text. Start the\nfirst word in a footnote with a capital letter, and end it with a period. You should not have\nlong, complex footnotes (especially mathematical proofs or derivations). If you can\u2019t inte-\ngrate these into the text, include them as an appendix to the text. A dedicated footnote\npage at the end of your text is not necessary.\nGenerally, you should avoid citing sources that are themselves cited in a source (secon-\ndary sources). Always try to find the original source. If you can\u2019t access the original source,\nhowever, citing a secondary source is acceptable. Cite the original source, then add \u201cas\ncited in\u201d , then cite the secondary source. Include only the secondary source in the refer-\nence list.\nTable 1\nCitation from a\nsecondary sourceCultural tourists can be divided into two groups: specific cultural tourists and gen-\neral cultural tourists (Irish Tourist Board, 1988 as cited in Steinecke, 2007, pp. 12\u2013\n13).\nQuotations in APA\nYou can use word-for-word (direct) quotations when the specific phrasing is important for\nyour text or it is very unique. However, to keep your own voice in your writing, do not\nstring too many quotations together. As a general rule, limit the number of quotations in\nyour text. This ensures that the text is your writing and really \u201cyours\u201d .\n66Short Quotations\nQuotations of up to 40 words are incorporated into the text with quotation marks.\nTable 2\nQuotation of a\ncomplete sentence\u201cThere is in fact evidence that changes in social practices, and even changes in\ntemporary states of social orientation, can change the way people perceive and\nthink\u201d (Nisbett, 2003, p. 226).\nQuotation at the\nstart of a sentence\u201cChanges in social practices, and even changes in temporary states of social orien-\ntation\u201d influence the way people see and think about the world, according to Nis-\nbett (2003, p. 226).\nQuotation in the\nmiddle of the sen-\ntenceNisbett (2003) writes that \u201cchanges in social practices, and even changes in tempo-\nrary states of social orientation\u201d have an impact on perception and thinking (p.\n226).\nor\nNisbett (2003, p. 226) explains that \u201cchanges in social practices, and even changes\nin temporary states of social orientation\u201d have an impact on perception and think-\ning.\nQuotation split\ninto parts\u201cChanges in social practices, and even changes in temporary states of social orien-\ntation\u201d have a significant impact, argues Nisbett (2003), and \u201ccan change the way\npeople perceive and think\u201d (p. 226).\nor\n\u201cChanges in social practices, and even changes in temporary states of social orien-\ntation\u201d have a significant impact, argues Nisbett (2003, p. 226), and \u201ccan change\nthe way people perceive and think\u201d .\nLong Quotations (Over 40 Words)\nIf the quotation is longer than 40 words, you should format it as an indented (1.27 cm/0.5\ninch) paragraph from the left.  There are a few other rules:\n\u2022Do not use quotation marks.\n\u2022Begin the quotation with a capital letter and finish with a period, then follow with the\npage number in brackets.\n67Table 3\nLong direct quota-\ntionFlores et al.

(Flores et al., p. 311)\nFurther Rules\n\u2022Quotations should be exactly as written in the source. That means that you should also\ninclude any typos or grammatical errors, but you can indicate these with a [ sic]. The first\nletter of the quotation can be changed to upper or lower case. The punctuation at the\nend of the quotation may be adjusted to suit the context.\n\u2022A quotation within a quotation is indicated with single quotation marks.\n\u2022If you leave out any word(s), indicate this with three periods. This does not apply if the\nquotation begins or ends in the middle of a sentence.\n\u2022Place additional comments in square brackets if needed.\n\u2022If the quotation emphasizes certain words with italics or bold, but you chose to leave\nthem out, indicate this directly after  the quotation [emphasis removed]. If you add your\nown emphasis you should also in-dicate this [emphasis added] directly after.\n\u2022Quotations in languages other than English are included as they are and translated in a\nfootnote.\nTable 4\nQuotation with a\ngrammatical errorNowak (2019) wrote that \u201cpeople have an obligation to care for there [ sic] pets\u201d (p.\n52).\nQuotation with\nemphasis in origi-\nnal\u201cThe means being used are \u2018co-laboratory\u2019 , and academics who receive funding\ndefine their research projects for themselves\u201d (Halvorsen & Skare Orgeret, 2019, p.\n1).\nQuotation with\nemphasis\nremoved\u201cThe means [emphasis removed] being used are \u2018co-laboratory\u2019 , and academics\nwho receive funding define their research projects for themselves\u201d (Halvorsen &\nSkare Orgeret, 2019, p. 1).\nQuotation with\nadditional com-\nments\u201cHowever, the diverse demographics of tourists and the diversity of their motiva-\ntions for travel \u2013 leisure, recreation, holidays, business meeting, conferences, sci-\nentific study, pilgrimage, health treatment \u2013 account for the complexity of the phe-\nnomenon [of tourism and tourists]\u201d (Goodwin, 2016, p. 6).\n68Quotation with\nseveral words left\nout\u201cHowever, the diverse demographics of tourists and the diversity of their motiva-\ntions for travel \u2026 account for the complexity of the phenomenon\u201d(Goodwin, 2016,\np. 6).\nQuotation with\nseveral words left\nout at beginning\nor at end of sen-\ntence\u201cThe diversity of their motivations for travel \u2013 leisure, recreation, holidays, busi-\nness meeting, conferences, scientific study, pilgrimage, health treatment \u2013\naccount[s] for the complexity of the phenomenon\u201d (Goodwin, 2016, p. 6).\nQuotation with\nadded emphasis\u201cHowever, the diverse demographics [emphasis added] of tourists and the diversity\nof their motivations for travel [emphasis added] \u2013 leisure, recreation, holidays, busi-\nness meeting, conferences, scientific study, pilgrimage, health treatment \u2013 account\nfor the complexity of the phenomenon\u201d (Goodwin, 2016, p. 6).\n\u2022Quotations from an audio book should be cited with a time stamp rather than a page\nnumber. The time stamp is the point at which the quotation begins.\nTable 5\nQuotation from an\naudio book\u201cThere were no visible houses, and I could tell by the state of the road that traffic\nwas very light hereabouts\u201d( Lovecraft,  2011, 5:09).\n\u2022Quotations from an eBook in EPUB format that doesn\u2019t have stable page numbers are\nindicated with the chapter (abbreviated as chap.). If the chapter is very long you can\nadd the number of the paragraph (abbreviated as para.).\nTable 6\nQuotation from an\neBook in EPUB for-\nmat\u201cThe primary objective of developing an autonomous vehicle is to reduce the num-\nber of accidents caused by humans\u201d (Ng, 2021, chap. 1.1).\nParaphrases in APA\nParaphrases are also known as indirect quotations, in which you take ideas from one or\nseveral sources and put them in your own words. Paraphrases do not use quotation\nmarks. A citation should also be provided for facts or figures that do not come from the\nliterature, but are instead, for example, from your own research. The degree to which this\nparaphrase relates to your text should be clear.\nTable 7\nParaphrase Sustainably aware consumers in Germany prefer to take holidays in their own\ncountry (Klein, 2014, p. 261).\n69In longer paraphrases that extend over several sentences, the citation should be placed in\nthe first sentence. If it is obvious that the paraphrase also continues in the following sen-\ntences, you do not have to include the citation again. This should improve the readability\nof the text. Care must be taken to ensure that it is obvious from the wording that the same\nsource is used throughout.\nHowever, if the same source is used again in a new paragraph, you must provide the cita-\ntion again.\nTable 8\nLonger paraphrase\nover two para-\ngraphsIn regards to leisure travel, sustainably aware consumers in Germany are character-\nised by a higher preference for holidays in their own country (Klein, 2014, pp. 261).\nThey also book sustainable travel options more often,  and do more research on\nsustainable tourism.\nIn general it can be said that the biggest differences  in the importance of sustaina-\nbility are seen in the selection of a hotel (Klein, 2014, p. 298).\nMultiple Authors\nIf there are two authors, connect their names with an \u201cand\u201d in the text, or \u201c&\u201d if you are\nusing brackets. If there are three or more authors, then provide just the name of the first\nauthor and continue with \u201cet al. \u201d . If there are several sources with the same two first\nauthors, you should provide as many names as are necessary to differentiate  the sources.\nMore than four authors are just indicated with \u201cet al. \u201d .\nTable 9\nTwo authors\nAuthors in the text According to Homburg and Krohmer (2011, p. 50) motivation and needs are closely\nrelated.\nor\nAccording to Homburg and Krohmer (2011) motivation and needs are closely rela-\nted (p. 50).\nAuthors in brack-\netsMotivation and needs are closely related (Homburg & Krohmer, 2011, p. 50).\nThree authors or more\nAuthors in the text Meffert  et al.

(Kapoor, Bloom, Zucker et al., 2017, p. 22)\nCitations of Several Sources\nIf you are referring to several sources (for example, to support an argument), list them\nalphabetically and separate them with a semicolon. If you are referring to two or more\nsources from the same author, arrange them chronologically and separate the years with a\ncomma. List the sources with unknown publication dates first.\nTable 10\nReferring to sev-\neral sourcesA growing number of studies examine the emotions of instructors while teaching\n(Frenzel, n.d., 2011, 2014; Frenzel et al., 2009; Hagenauer et al., 2015; Keller, 2014,\n2016).\nAuthors with the Same Last Name\nTo prevent confusion, include the initials of authors that share a last name.\nTable 11\nAuthors with the\nsame last nameThe study conducted by A. Klein (2014) found that \u2026\nCiting Personal Communication\nInclude personal (expert) interviews, notes from conversations, letters, emails, internal\ncompany documents not available to the public and other personal communication only\nin the text and not in the reference list. If you are quoting a person, ensure that they con-\nsent to this first.\nTable 12\nCitation from an\ninterviewT\u00f6lzer Land\u2019s tourism organisation sees the diversification of the existing winter\nofferings  as necessary (A. Schmidt, director of T\u00f6lzer Land Tourism, personal inter-\nview on 20.02.2018, see Appendix XYZ).\nCitation from an\nemailThe tourism businesses in the Berchtesgadener Land are mostly small and mid-\nsized family businesses (P .

Each interview\nmust be completely transcribed word for word\u2014do not summarize or write phonetically.\nHowever, if there is a section that is out of context, you can use bullet points. Include the\nname of the person you interviewed, the date and the location (or if appropriate, \u201cby tele-\nphone\u201d). Your participants must consent to their names being used. If they do not con-\nsent, you can anonymize their names (\u201cExpert A\u201d).\nLecture notes, lecture slides, webinars, etc. are not to be used as sources in academic\nwork.\nOrganization as Author\nIf you cannot find the name of the author, provide the name of the organization instead.\nTable 13\nOrganization as\nauthorThe Lufthansa  Group is divided into the following business segments: passenger\nairlines, logistics, MRO, catering and other activities ( Lufthansa  Group, 2018).\nIf the name of the organization has an acronym, you can include it in brackets in the first\ncitation. In later citations you can just use the acronym.\nTable 14\nFirst citation In 2017 Germany held the ninth position in international arrivals numbers (United\nNations World Tourism Organization [UNWTO], 2017).\nFurther citations For several years France has held the first position (UNWTO, 2017).\nIf you cannot identify the name of the organization, use the title instead.\nTable 15\nUnknown organi-\nzation\u201cList of Oldest Companies\u201d(2019) or (\u201cList of Oldest Companies\u201d , 2019)\nUnknown Date\nIf you cannot identify the year of publication, use \u201cn.d. \u201d (no date).\n72Table 16\nUnknown publica-\ntion dateRay und Anderson (n.d.) estimated the proportion of sustainably aware consumers\nin the USA in 2008 to be about a third.\nOnline Sources\nOnline sources are cited exactly like books or journals: in the text you give an abbreviated\ncitation and in the reference list the full one. The title or web address is not included in the\ncitation. A general reference to a website does not need a citation or an entry in the refer-\nence list. Instead, provide the name of the site in brackets in the text.\nTable 17\nCitation from an\nonline sourceFollowing the fusion with the Adam Ries University of Applied Sciences in Septem-\nber 2013, the study programmes were offered  under the IUBH Dual Studies Munich\nname (IUBH Internationale Hochschule GmbH, 2018).\nGeneral reference\nto a webpageThe survey was created using the Unipark (www.unipark.de) online survey tool.\n4.5 Bibliography\nAny academic work must include a reference list at the end. This is the complete list of all\nthe academic sources that you mentioned in your work as well as other materials that you\nhave referred to.\nThe reference list provides a transparent list of the sources you used for the text. Your\nreader must be able to locate and check each source. In order to do so, the following rules\napply: accuracy (the source must be correct); completeness (provide enough information\nthat makes it possible to find the source); consistency (use a particular format through-\nout); and clarity. List sources in alphabetical  order by author, and chronologically by pub-\nlication date in the case of several sources from one author. After  the last name of the\nauthor, provide their initials and the year of publication in brackets. Space the list at 1.5\nand align with the left margin; from the second line a reference is indented by 1.27 cm.\nBeyond these rules the following also apply:\n\u2022Do not use dashes, hyphens or bullet points.\n\u2022The names of books, journals or newspapers are in italics.\n\u2022Titles of all works, such as books, articles and webpages are written in sentence case in\nthe reference list, even if title case has been used in the original work. Use \u201c:\u201d to sepa-\nrate title and subtitle.\n\u2022If one author has several publications in one year, add a, b, c \u2026 after  the year of publica-\ntion.\n\u2022If an author appears several times in your reference list, work in chronological order.\n\u2022If you do not have a publication date, indicate this with \u201cn.d. \u201d (no date).\n\u2022If there is no information about the volume of a journal, leave this out altogether.\n73\u2022If you do not have the name of the author, provide the title instead, then follow with the\nyear or the date and the rest of the reference.\n\u25e6Example with  author: Sapolsky, R. M. (2017). Behave: The biology of humans at our\nbest and worst . Penguin Books.\n\u25e6Example without  author: Behave: The biology of humans at our best and worst.\n(2017). Penguin Books.\n\u2022Do not separate sources by types such as print, online, etc. All sources are in one list.\n\u2022Separate authors by a comma. From two to 20 authors include \u201c&\u201d before the last\nauthor.\n\u2022From 21 authors or more provide the first 19, then type \u201c\u2026 \u201d , then the name of the last\nauthor.\n\u2022If a source is the first edition, you do not need to indicate the edition.\n\u2022Do not include academic titles of the author(s) or editor(s).\n\u2022In the case of organizations as authors or editors, a period should be placed after  the\nname of the organization (Institution. (year))\nParticular Rules for Electronic Online Sources\n\u2022If possible, provide the digital object identifier (DOI). If there is no DOI, provide the URL.\nIf you\u2019re using an electronic version of a source that is also available in print, cite the\nelectronic version.\n\u2022The URL should be a permalink that leads the reader directly to the source. As this is not\nalways possible, in certain cases the procedure is different:\n\u25e6If you accessed a source through a password-protected online database or eBook\nplatform and it does not have a DOI, do not provide the URL. Cite as you would for a\nprint version.\n\u25e6If you use a one-time link to an online session (e.g., collecting statistical data on\nDestatis) provide the URL as precisely as possible. If this is not an option, use the\nlogin or main page. You should explain in the text which data you used.\nMonographs in APA\neBooks are cited the same way as print books. Include the DOI of an electronic version of a\nsource if it is available. If there is no DOI for a freely available source, provide the URL. If\nthe source is not freely available online and there is no DOI, provide the same information\nas you would for a printed source.\nOne author: Last name, initials. (Year).

You should\nprovide the author of the document, the year it was last updated (on a homepage, the last\nyear the copyright was updated), the title, the name of the website or the institution and\nthe exact location. You don\u2019t need to provide the date you retrieved the information. The\nlocation is the DOI, if available; otherwise provide the complete URL (if available, the per-\nmalink). The DOI is much like a serial number and so gives digital work a unique and per-\nmanent identifier.\nIf no author is available, provide the name of the institution that publishes the work\ninstead. In this case leave the name of the website out if it is identical to the name of the\ninstitution. In your text, online sources are cited in the same way as print sources. If you\ncite several pages of a website, you should have a separate reference list entry for each.\nFollow these rules to refer to online sources in the reference list:\n76\u2022If you can identify the author: provide their name\n\u2022If you can identify the name of the institution: provide it (you can find this in the imprint\npage, or terms of service or legal sections)\n\u2022In other cases, provide the name of the website.\nTable 21\nPDF document\n(with report\nnumber)Stuster, J., Adolf, J., Byrne, V., & Greene, M.

This unit reviews the most important expect-\nations regarding efficient  searches and systematized literature when\nwriting scholarly papers, with special emphasis placed on the avoidance\nof plagiarism. The unit explains how to meet these requirements by\nusing literature management software  and uploading texts to the plagia-\nrism software  Turnitin, as well as which citation rules and writing guide-\nlines must be followed to ensure quality work.\n78UNIT 5\nACADEMIC WORK AT IU: WRITTEN\nASSIGNMENT AND RESEARCH ESSAYS\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 how a research essay at IU is structured.\n\u2013about different  types of instructions to create a written assignment and a research\nessay.\n\u2013which formalities have to be observed when writing a written assignment and a\nresearch essay.\n\u2013what requirements are put on the scope and content of a written assignment and a\nresearch essay.5.ACADEMIC WORK AT IU: WRITTEN\nASSIGNMENT AND RESEARCH ESSAYS\nCase Study\nMaike has to write a research essay. She wants to explore \u201cEqual economic opportunities\nin the time of digitalization and technology\u201d . This is a topic that Maike is keenly interested\nin because she herself wants to have a career and find a way to balance that with also hav-\ning a family. It therefore makes sense to address the opportunities, hurdles, and chal-\nlenges from an objective perspective rather than from a purely subjective perspective. She\ncollects search terms for an initial search in the online library and develops a common\nthread\u2014an initial rough outline for the introduction, body, and conclusion of her essay. In\norder to avoid misunderstandings, Maike once again reviews the differences  between a\nwritten assignment and a research essay.\n5.1 Written Assignments and Research\nEssays at IU\nThe written assignment and research essay belong to the various forms of academic work\nthat are written in almost every course of study. In many classes, research essays are\nrequired. This has, among other things, the purpose of preparing the student for the final\nbachelor thesis. Although the contents and structures of these works differ  among scien-\ntific disciplines because subject-specific traditions play a role, the most important aspects\nare quite similar and in many cases are also congruent. The following statements there-\nfore represent a \u201clowest common denominator\u201d and also reflect the formal requirements\nof IU. The specific requirements can be found in the Exam Guide in myCampus for\nresearch essays/written assignments and the specific tasks in the particular courses.\nIndependent scienific working is learned through writing such assignments and research\nessays. For this purpose, it is first necessary to choose a scientific topic, to specify a\nresearch question, to search for, and evaluate, appropriate literature, and, finally, to\npresent and theoretically substantiate one's own thoughts and findings.\nStructure\nThe structure of written assignments and research essays typically follows a classical pat-\ntern:\n1. Introduction\na) Rationale for chosen topic\nb) Aim of the work\n80Formal components\nThese are the elements\nthat must be included.c) Definition of the topic and research question to be addressed\nd) Overview of structure\n2. Body\na) Identify main points\nb) Explain, discuss, and supplement main statement(s) with additional statements\nc) Draw conclusions from the reasoning (which lead to the next step)\n3. Conclusion\na) Summary of argument\nb) Summary with student\u2019s own conclusions\nc) To what extent has the aim of the work been achieved?\nd) Statement with further open questions and/or perspectives\nThis is a general structure but does not mean that each section title\u2014introduction, body,\nand conclusion\u2014must be chosen. The body should be given a different  title. However, it is\nimportant to internalize the basic structure of the written assignment/research essay. The\nstructure of the written assignment/research essay is determined by the logical sequence\nof the main points and explanatory steps. The entire text should be closed and complete\nin terms of content and should have a straightforward structure. Logical transitions must\nbe created between the individual sections by rephrasing the central statement of the pre-\nvious section, in order to lead to the objectives of the next section. The core of the work is\nthe body, which is framed by an introduction and a conclusion. The following approximate\nproportions can be assumed to give a rough orientation frame:\n\u2022introduction, approximately 20 percent of the work\n\u2022body, approximately 70 percent of the work\n\u2022conclusion, approximately 10 percent of the work\nThis serves as a rough outline; it all very much depends on the specifics of each written\nassignment and research essay.\nFormal Guidelines and Specifications for Submission\nIn addition to the sections previously described, IU has other formal components  which\nmust be incorporated into every written assignment and research essay.\nA written assignment and research essay consists of the following parts (in this order):\n\u2022title page\n\u2022table of contents\n\u2022list of figures and/or tables (if necessary)\n\u2022list of abbreviations (if necessary)\n\u2022text part with introduction, body, conclusion\n\u2022bibliography\n\u2022list of appendices (if necessary)\n\u2022appendices and materials (if necessary)\n81Formal Document Requirements\nThe following formal guidelines apply to written assignments and research essays.\nTable 6: Formal IU Requirements for Written Assignments and Research Essays\nLength 7\u201310 pages of text\nPaper size DIN-A4\nMargins Top and bottom 2 cm; left 2 cm; right 2 cm\nFont General text: Arial 11 pt.; Headings: 12 pt. justified\nLine spacing 1.5\nSentence structure Justified and use of hyphens to separate words\nFootnotes Arial 10 pt. font, justified\nParagraph 6 pt. distance after  line break\nSection/subsection levels Maximum three levels (1. Main heading, 1.1 Section, 1.1.1 Sub-\nheadings)\nOnly individual chapters in the text are numbered consecutively;\notherwise, sections of the assignment, such as the list of figures\nor the bibliography, are not numbered.\nDo not use the underline function, and use italics sparingly to\nemphasize passages.\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nThe written assignment or research essays should be submitted to the Turnitin online por-\ntal. The exact steps of submission can be found in a separate manual on myCampus. There\nit is also explained how the evaluation can be viewed directly on Turnitin after  the publica-\ntion of the grade on myCampus. It is not possible to deliver the examination by email or\nother means.\nIt is important that the affidavit  is first submitted electronically via myCampus. Prior to\nthis, it is not possible to submit the work. Further information can be found in the\n\u201cInstructions for Submissions in myCampus\u2014Turnitin\u201d .\nWritten assignments and research essays differ  both in the requirements and in the didac-\ntic focus. Written assignments are only demanded in courses with course book, research\nessays are demanded in courses without course book. The specific requirements are\nexplained below.\n82Topic and Task of the Written Assignment\nFor a written assignment, a task is assigned or one can select from several alternative\ntasks. It is important to thoroughly examine the task and to try to align the work exactly. It\nis not sufficient  for the written assignment to use only the course book as a source of infor-\nmation; rather, it is expected to use additional relevant sources. These can be found, for\nexample, in our online library databases.\nIn written assignment task, several support channels are open; as the student, it is your\nresponsibility to select your preferred support channel. The tutor is available for technical\nconsultations and for formal and general questions regarding the procedure for process-\ning the written assignment. However, the tutor is not required to approve outlines or parts\nof texts and drafts.  Independent preparation is part of the examination work and is inclu-\nded in the overall evaluation. However, general editing tips and instructions are given in\norder to help you get started with the written assignment.\nEvaluation of the Written Assignment\nThe assessment of a written assignment contains several components.\nTable 7: Evaluation of a Written Assignment\nCriterion Explanation\nIntroduction Introduction and selection of topic\nStructure Structure and design\nReasoning Quality of reasoning and research\nConclusion Conclusion and recommendations\nLanguage Linguistic expression and spelling\nTidiness Cleanliness in presentation and citation\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nTopic and Task of a Research Essay\nThere are different  subject areas to choose from. For the concrete selection of the essay\ntopic, there are two possibilities: Choosing one of the already given questions or coming\nup with own ideas within the subject area. In this case, it has to be considered that the\nquestion must be agreed and approved upon in advance with the tutor. The independent\ndelimitation and formulation of a question represents a good preparation and exercise,\nespecially regarding the later thesis. Introductory literature references are given for each\nof the subject areas, which can serve as a starting point. It is expected that further litera-\nture sources will be researched and incorporated into the research essay. It should be\nnoted that the theoretical approach and the related literature review are the main focus of\nthe research essay.\n83The tutorial support in research essays is similar to the support in written assignments.\nEvaluation of a Research Essay\nThe demands of a research essay are higher than those of a written assignment, specifi-\ncally with regard to level of personal contribution and the scientific structure.\nTable 8: Evaluation of a Research Essay\nCriterion Explanation\nIntroduction Structure of the objectives\nStructure Development and process\nTheory Literature analysis, application and understanding of defini-\ntions and precedents, quality of sources\nMethodology Clear information on the chosen methodology, justification,\ncorrect application, use of theoretical and practical aspects\nReasoning Quality of argumentation/conclusive development, clarity and\naccuracy of reasoning, topic comprehension, connection\nbetween theoretical and practical, critical assessment of the\nfindings and own interpretation\nConclusion Conclusions and recommendations\nPresentation Cleanliness of the presentation\nAccuracy Spelling/punctuation\nLanguage Linguistic expression\nLiterature References/literature list\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nFurther specification and guidelines can be found in the respective Exam Guide in myCam-\npus and the guidelines of particular courses.\n84UNIT 6\nACADEMIC WORK AT IU: PROJECT REPORTS\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 how a project report at IU is developed.\n\u2013 which instructions to use to write a project report.\n\u2013 which principles need to be observed when writing a project report.\n\u2013 the requirements encompassing both the scope and content of a project report.6.ACADEMIC WORK AT IU: PROJECT\nREPORTS\nCase Study\nAs part of a pilot project at zielNET , a superfood product will be introduced with new mar-\nketing. A peer group will accompany the entire relaunch for 12 months. The idea to\ninclude the input of a \u201creflective team\u201d originates from the increasingly popular theory of\nagile process methods. This means that a group of approximately 15 people will, at regu-\nlar intervals, provide feedback on the steps for the live and on-site relaunch. The goal is to\ninitiate a permanent improvement process so that the market launch of the new super-\nfood product will be successful. Simon, a student at IU, will be heavily involved in the\nproject as project coordinator, and will be using this opportunity to write a project report,\nwhich he will publish in the Marketing module. After  an initial brainstorming session with\nhis boss and project manager, Simon asks the following questions: What should the\nmotive for the project report be? What must be included in each case? As far as the\nmotives are concerned, the project report is certainly first and foremost about recording\nthe course of a project as accurately as possible, i.e., mapping the entire process in its indi-\nvidual process steps and associated tasks. In this context, Simon remembers the PDCA\ncycle (Plan, Do, Check, Act). Projects can be planned, developed, implemented, and\nreviewed with the help of this management tool. Supplemental files containing a collec-\ntion of resources, all flow into the project report. Simon quickly realizes that a project\nreport is a valuable document and sees the importance of this exercise, challenging him to\ncombine theory and practice together.\n6.1 The IU Project Report\nThe performance review of a project report is to see that the student is able to successfully\ndevelop a project that is independently conceived, implemented, and written. If neces-\nsary, this process can be supervised by the respective tutor. The difference  from a research\nessay or written assignment lies in the project part\u2014the practical aspect that precedes the\nproject report.\nThe project report as a way to test student knowledge combines expertise with its transfer\ninto practice on the basis of a concrete project, such as the transfer to a concrete practical\nproblem in a real workplace.\nThe result of a project report always consists of a \u201cproduct\u201d in the actual or figurative\nsense. This can be of a physical nature (e.g., an engineering model) or can also consist of a\nconcept, software  solution, installation, process, or the like.\n86Parameterization\nGuidelines and reference\nvalues are types of\nparameters.\nDeviations from the\nstructure\nA fixed structure is not as\nnecessary in a project\nreport as in other written\nformats.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction provides\na brief overview, key\nobjectives, and context\nabout the project.The project report should provide information as completely, precisely, and comprehensi-\nbly as possible about the individual work, development steps, and approach. The project\nreport is thus the protocol of the entire project management process with its intermediate\nsteps and products, including a reflection on the approach and methodology. Part of the\nproject report is also to procure the necessary resources for implementation. These may\nconsist of data, surveys, applications, technical equipment, software,  various tools, etc.\nThe end product shall also be suitably and appropriately documented and, if necessary,\nthe use in a typical user situation simulated and exemplified. Important: The selection,\nparameterization , and use of programs (software,  tools, apps, etc.) is also an integral part\nof the project for conceptual topics.\nThe Structure of a Project Report\nIn order to develop a product in the sense of the project report, a multi-stage procedure is\nnecessary. These steps are reflected in the project report in various sections and subsec-\ntions, which can be oriented to the following structure. Depending on the focus and scope\nof the project, deviations from this structure  are also possible. It is therefore not their\nstrict adherence that is central, but rather an adequate adaptation to the specific project\ncarried out in each individual case. The orientation to central questions, which serve as a\nframework during the project, can also serve to aid the development of a suitable struc-\nture of the project report. The project report is then created as completely as possible by\nanswering these key questions as a continuous text with (partial) headings.\nThe definition of the structure in meaningful sections, subsections, and units can differ\ndepending on the project and the part to be addressed. This includes, for example, the\nnaming of project partners or sponsors.\nThe basic structure typically adheres to the following pattern:\n\u2022Introduction: Presentation of the project objectives and preparatory measures as well\nas the tools used\n\u2022Body: Presentation of the procedure for project implementation\n\u2022Conclusion: Summary of the results achieved\nThis does not mean that these headings\u2014Introduction, Body, and Conclusion\u2014should be\nchosen for the three sections. The body of the text especially should be named differently.\nHowever, it is important to understand the basic structure of the project report.\nIntroduction\nIn the introduction  it is first necessary to define the problem, analyze the initial condi-\ntions, and outline the objectives. At the beginning of the introduction, the project idea\nshould be briefly presented, with a short description of the content and goal(s) as well as,\nif needed, a description of the underlying context, project environment, and initial motiva-\ntion. This part should comprise of 10\u201320 percent of the report. Part of the introduction is\nalso a brief explanation of the process for solving the problem, e.g., by giving a short over-\nview of the individual chapters.\n87Body\nThe body of the project\nreport presents the con-\ncrete project in its devel-\nopment, implementation,\nand review. The results\nand resources play an\nimportant role in this\nprocess.\nConclusion\nThis part entails a reflec-\ntion and a critical analysis\nof the whole project.The preliminary planning and the process is also described. The following key questions\ncan serve as guidance for the introductory section:\n\u2022What was the goal/what were the goals of my work?\n\u2022How did I go about it? What preparatory measures have been taken? (data collection,\ndata analysis, evaluation of material, etc.)\n\u2022Which planning/organizational activities were necessary?\n\u2022Why did I proceed this way?\n\u2022Which methodology/tool did I choose and why?\nBody\nThe body  of the project report should describe the actual implementation of the project.\nThis includes special milestones and challenges that may have arisen during the course of\nthe project. All (development) steps must be recorded in the project report; interim results\nshould be recorded. A further requirement is that the project be carried out efficiently  and\nwith the available, limited resources. Experience has shown that the body of the report\nshould comprise around 70\u201380 percent of the report. Keywords for the description of the\nproject implementation are:\n\u2022stakeholders\n\u2022risk analysis\n\u2022main tasks: phase planning/project phases\n\u2022project structure plan\n\u2022project progress/progress report\n\u2022sequence and scheduling of important dates and events (start/end event, start/end\ndate)\n\u2022project resources: resource/cost planning\nConclusion\nThe conclusion  of the project report is dedicated to the project results, i.e., the evalua-\ntion. It should comprise about 10\u201320 percent of the report and contain both a detailed\nreflection and critical analysis of the project when evaluating its results. The following\npoints should be incorporated when crafting  the conclusion:\n\u2022Achievement of objectives: What result was achieved? Does the result correspond to the\ngoal of the work? If not, why not?\n\u2022What conclusions can be drawn from the course of the project? What can be improved,\nif needs be?\n\u2022Where appropriate, provide reflections on efforts  made and project due dates.\n\u2022Where appropriate, provide reflections on available resources and costs.\nFormal Guidelines and Submission Requirements\nIn addition to the written portion, there are other formal elements to be included in every\nproject report. A project report consists of the following parts (in this order):\n88\u2022title page\n\u2022table of contents\n\u2022list of figures and/or tables (if necessary)\n\u2022list of abbreviations (if necessary)\n\u2022text part with introduction, body, conclusion\n\u2022bibliography\n\u2022list of appendices (if necessary)\n\u2022appendices and materials (if necessary)\nFormal Document Requirements\nThe following formal requirements apply to the text of the project report:\nTable 9: Formal IU Project Report Requirements\nLength 7-10 pages of text\nPaper size DIN-A4\nMargins Top and bottom 2 cm; left 2 cm; right 2 cm\nFont General text: Arial 11 pt., Headings: 12 pt., justified\nLine spacing 1.5\nSentence structure Justified, with auto-hyphenation\nFootnotes Arial 10 pt., justified\nParagraphs 6 pt. distance after  line break\nSection/Sub-sections Maximum three levels (1. Main heading, 1.1 Section, 1.1.1 Sub-\nheadings)\nOnly individual chapters in the text are numbered consecutively;\notherwise, sections of the assignment, such as the list of figures\nor the bibliography, are not numbered.\nDo not underline; use italics sparingly to emphasize passages\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nThe submission of the project report happens via the Turnitin portal. Instructions on how\nto submit this can be found in a separate manual on myCampus. There you can also find\nout how the evaluation can be viewed directly on Turnitin after  the publication of the\ngrade on myCampus. It is not possible to deliver the information by email or by other\nmeans.\nIt is important that the affidavit  first be submitted electronically via myCampus. Prior to\nthis, it is not possible to submit your report. Further information on this can be found in\nthe \u201cInstructions for Submission in myCampus\u2014Turnitin\u201d .\n89Task\nFor the project report several topics are proposed. Typically, students are expected to\ndescribe a theory-based, conceptually-structured implementation of the project, ideally\nlinking it to the student's personal work context as much as possible. Details on the topic\nand tasks of the project reports are then given in the respective courses. Any questions\nregarding the task can be discussed with the responsible tutor.\nIn this project report task, several support channels are open; as the student, it is your\nresponsibility to select your preferred support channel. The tutor is available for technical\nconsultations and for formal and general questions regarding the procedure for process-\ning the project report. However, the tutor is not required to approve outlines or parts of\ntexts and drafts.  Independent preparation is part of the examination work and is included\nin the overall evaluation. However, general editing tips and instructions are given in order\nto help getting started with the project report.\nFurther specification and guidelines can be found in the respective Exam Guide in myCam-\npus and the guidelines of particular courses.\n90UNIT 7\nACADEMIC WORK AT IU: CASE STUDIES\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 how a case study at IU is structured.\n\u2013 what instructions to use to create a case study.\n\u2013 what formalities need to be observed when creating a case study.\n\u2013 what requirements encompass both the scope and content of a case study.7.ACADEMIC WORK AT IU: CASE STUDIES\nCase Study\nMaike becomes a member of the Business Ladies\u2014a network for young, female executives\nthat operates internationally. During the first meeting, she meets Tilda, a 38-year-old\nmother of a 13-month-old son who was, until 13 months ago, the head of the public rela-\ntions department at an energy company with approximately 1,000 employees. With the\nbirth of her son, however, she was immediately removed from her managerial position by\nthe company\u2019s management, which is of the opinion that women\u2014just like men\u2014can only\nexercise leadership positions on a full-time basis. Tilda agreed to a 75 percent part-time\nposition at the end of her maternity leave. After  eight years in a company-wide manage-\nment position, she now is only in charge of the administration in her own department.\nMaike and Tilda agree that this is unfair and possibly illegal, but should Tilda risk her cur-\nrent job for a lawsuit now that she is more dependent than ever on the income it pro-\nvides? Maike would like to write a case study about Tilda's situation, a requirement for her\nstudies in the Management Techniques module. She asks Tilda if she would be willing to\nparticipate in a more in depth interview. The \u201cTilda\u201d case is to be portrayed systematically.\nWith the help of the interview and previously developed key questions, the identified\nshortcomings, needs for action, and draft  political laws for the future will be discussed\nand reflected upon.\n7.1 The IU Case Study\nCase studies have a prominent place in academics. What is the value of a case study for\nstudents? The value lies, in particular, in the fact that a concrete practical case serves as a\nbasis for systematically applying the theories conveyed in the course, i.e., to analyze the\ncase with that information and, if possible, to find a solution. Case studies are often  com-\nplex and do not provide all the details the solution would require. This simulates situa-\ntions in professional practice which, especially in the case of major challenges, only limi-\nted contextual information is available. Managers must be able to deal with missing\ninformation\u2014therein lies the value in case studies.\nThe analysis and processing of case studies plays an important role in modern studies\nbecause they promote important competences in solution-oriented thinking and decision-\nmaking. Case studies also train the practical transfer of theoretical knowledge and models\nlearned in (self-)study. Case studies are a teaching method in which students work on a\nspecific \u201ccase\u201d that represents a practical problem situation.\nCase studies occur in a wide variety of professional contexts and are used for various pur-\nposes in professional practice, studies, teaching, and research. Classical case studies are\noften  reflections on actual decisions from the past based on real data. However, fictitious\ncompany and organizational cases are equally suitable for this purpose.\n92Case studies do not contain a structured preparation of knowledge as textbooks do. The\ntask of case studies can be seen more like real life: complex, incomplete, unstructured,\nimprecise, and ambiguous.\nGeneral Learning Objectives\nCase studies seek to gain useful insights through the analytical consideration of example\nquestions from the respective professional practice. Ideally, these findings can be abstrac-\nted and transferred to other cases and situations. In this way, case studies support the\ndevelopment of analytical skills and sharpen the ability to separate the important from\nthe unimportant and to open up new alternatives for action.\nStructure and General Instructions\nA case study should follow the classic pattern:\n1. Introduction (case context and explanation)\n2. Body (case presentation, processing, and solution)\n3. Conclusion (discussion and further transfers)\nOf course, this does not mean that these headings\u2014Introduction, Body, and Conclusion\u2014\nshould be the only ones chosen for the three sections; other heading titles are acceptable\nas well. However, it is important that the case study has a logical structure that is clearly\ncomprehensible to the reader. Further suggestions on how to structure the case study are\nnot possible here due to the variety of possible case studies to use in one\u2019s coursework.\nCase studies have special features that can also lead to challenges while working on them.\nSuch challenges are desired because case studies exist to prepare students for situations\nthat can occur in everyday professional life. This also includes the fact that case studies\noften  do not contain all the information one would wish to have, another parallel to every-\nday life.\nIn principle, case study tasks always lack details, so it is a part of the task to find out what\nthe concrete case study is about. This implies that there is neither a right question nor a\nright answer. Instead, it is about the process of finding a solution, considering various\nquestions and different  competing approaches. There are no right or wrong solutions in\ncase studies. What is more important is how the proposed solution is justified.\nThe purpose of analysis is not to reproduce learned knowledge, e.g., to explain a method\nor concept in detail, but rather to apply knowledge and experience to a decision-making\nsituation, i.e., transfer. When working on the case study, it is important to adhere to aca-\ndemic standards. This includes the use of subject-specific literature beyond the course-\nbook, the ability to cite correctly, and the preparation of a bibliography.\nFormal Guidelines and Submission Requirements\nIn addition to the information provided above, the case study has other formal compo-\nnents that must be integrated into every case study. It consists of the following parts (in\nthis order):\n93\u2022title page\n\u2022table of contents\n\u2022list of figures and/or tables (if necessary)\n\u2022list of abbreviations (if necessary)\n\u2022text part with introduction, body, conclusion\n\u2022bibliography\n\u2022list of appendices (if necessary)\n\u2022appendices and materials (if necessary)\nFormal Document Requirements\nThe following formal requirements apply to the text of the case study.\nTable 10: Formal IU Requirements for Case Studies\nLength 7\u201310 pages of text\nPaper size DIN-A4\nMargins Top and bottom 2 cm; left 2 cm; right 2 cm\nFont General text: Arial 11 pt.; Headings: 12 pt., justified\nLine spacing 1.5\nSentences Justified, auto-hyphenation\nFootnotes Arial 10 pt., justified\nParagraph 6 pt. distance after  line break\nSection/subsection levels Maximum three levels (1.

Prior to\nthis, it is not possible to submit your case study. Further information on this can be found\nin the \u201cInstructions for Submission in myCampus\u2014Turnitin\u201d .\n94Task\nFor the case study several topics are proposed. Details on the topic and task of the case\nstudy are provided in the respective courses. Any questions regarding the task can then be\ndiscussed with the tutor.\nStudents have the option to make use of any one of several opportunities to get support\nfor their case study analysis with the course tutor. Taking advantage of these opportuni-\nties is the responsibility of the student and the use of these services is voluntary. It is pos-\nsible to contact the tutor regarding formal and general questions about working on the\ncase study. Please note: a review of outlines and aspects of the presentation is not inten-\nded here, since the student\u2019s ability to work independently is part of the evaluation and\ncounts as a part of the overall assessment. There are however general tips for developing\nthe case study to help you getting started.\nFurther specification and guidelines can be found in the respective Exam Guide in myCam-\npus and the guidelines of particular courses.\n95UNIT 8\nACADEMIC WORK AT IU: THE BACHELOR\nTHESIS\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 how a bachelor thesis at IU is structured.\n\u2013 which instructions to use to write a bachelor thesis.\n\u2013 which formalities need to be observed when writing a bachelor thesis.\n\u2013 the requirements encompassing both the scope and content of a bachelor thesis.8.ACADEMIC WORK AT IU: THE BACHELOR\nTHESIS\nCase Study\nSimon can hardly believe it. Just six more months and his studies are done with the com-\npletion of his bachelor thesis. So many ups and downs, so many new experiences, so\nmuch effort  given to balance the multiple demands of work, study, family, and leisure\ntime. According to lecturers and professors, the bachelor thesis crowns the academic\nqualification process with an application-oriented question that is ideally relevant to\none's own career and life. In the thesis, new findings are to be developed that apply to\none\u2019s vocation. Simon therefore chooses the following topic for his bachelor thesis: \u201cThe\nimportance of digital word-of-mouth propaganda in marketing, using the example of the\nDaily Greens superfood brand\u201d .\nSimon chooses empirical methodological triangulation for this purpose. This means that\nhe develops an online questionnaire which he will send via the Student Administration to\na representative sample of students from his study program. In addition, Simon will con-\nduct five qualitative, guided interviews with fellow students from his class who have Twit-\nter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. Simon will use both empirical methods to compile\nthe findings and interpret them for his own company using this example of super foods.\n8.1 The Bachelor Thesis at IU\nThe bachelor thesis represents the completion of one\u2019s academic studies. Typically, the\nknowledge acquired during the studies is processed in a comprehensive academic work\nand new knowledge is generated on the basis of an investigation in a specific subject area.\nThe bachelor thesis often  poses great challenges for students, since the vast majority of\nthe work is done independently, albeit under the supervision of the professor. In addition\nto a high degree of discipline and self-organization, conscientiousness also plays a special\nrole when working on one\u2019s bachelor thesis. This academic work not only represents the\nfinal step of the academic study program, but also offers  students the opportunity to link\ntheory with relevant questions of professional practice in such a way that the results can\nalso be used professionally. For many students, the thesis is also an important contribu-\ntion to career development.\nIt is therefore of great importance to familiarize yourself with the Thesis Handbook found\nin the myCampus course \u201cInformation Thesis in General\u201d . It contains all essential informa-\ntion about the bachelor thesis. The handbook is a detailed orientation aid for the writing\nof the thesis for IU's distance learning program. With the bachelor thesis, students have\nthe opportunity to identify a topic, develop a research question, and work out answers to\n98Title page\nThe title page is the first\npage of a bachelor's the-\nsis and contains specific,\nmandatory information.the research question based on theory, rules, and theme-specific literature. Students must\nalso demonstrate the ability to carry out research methodically convincing and be able to\npresent the results of the study both in writing and orally.\nThe following reviews the process from the preparation of the bachelor thesis to its sub-\nmission. More detailed information on finding a supervisor, the registration process, the\ncorresponding processing deadlines, and the like can also be found in the Thesis Hand-\nbook.\nGeneral Learning Objectives\nA bachelor thesis is a work of academic research that includes both theory and practical\napplication. It includes identifying a topic that is relevant for a specific research area. The\nfinal thesis should show that students are able to independently work on a topic from one\nof the subject areas of the degree program within a given period of time, both in its techni-\ncal details and interdisciplinary contexts, by using scientific methods. In addition, stu-\ndents must be able to present and defend the thesis in front of a commitee. A thesis can\nonly be successfully completed if (1) there is real interest in the topic, (2) there is willing-\nness and determination to become an expert in the subject area of the thesis, and (3) stu-\ndents fully support their respective research project. By working on the thesis, students\nwill be able to identify, develop, carry out, analyze, and present a research project within\nthe timeframe specified.\nStructure\nThe following explanations are intended to give an overview of the structural elements of\na bachelor thesis. Adhere to the following list in the order provided:\n\u2022front page\n\u2022lock flag (optional)\n\u2022acknowledgments (optional)\n\u2022abstract\n\u2022table of contents\n\u2022list of figures/tables (if required)\n\u2022list of abbreviations (if required)\n\u2022body\n\u2022bibliography\n\u2022appendix\n\u2022glossary (optional)\n\u2022affidavit  (also called declaration of authenticity)\nIn rare cases, the supervisor can request a different  thesis structure. In this case, it is nec-\nessary to coordinate accordingly.\nThe title page  is the first page seen by the reader. Apart from the information listed below,\nnothing else should appear on the title page. The following should be included:\n\u2022full name of the university (no abbreviations, even if the logo is present)\n99Acknowledgement page\nThe acknowledgement\npage enables the author\nto thank all those who\ncontributed to the suc-\ncess.\nAbstract\nAn abstract allows the\nauthor to describe the\nessential content in a\nmaximum of 200 words.\u2022name of the degree program (no abbreviations)\n\u2022title of the thesis\n\u2022name of the author\n\u2022matriculation number\n\u2022address of the author\n\u2022name of the first supervisor\n\u2022submission date\nThe acknowledgement page  serves to acknowledge those who helped during the crea-\ntion of the work. An acknowledgement page is not mandatory. However, if it becomes part\nof the work, the following should be observed. The bachelor thesis will be published and\nmade publicly accessible over a long period of time. For this reason, attention should be\npaid to who is acknowledged. Usually students acknowledge their parents, their supervi-\nsor, data sources (e.g., persons interviewed), and the proofreaders. The thesis reflects the\nhard work from the students and various supporters and for this reason it should not be a\nlist of friends. The acknowledgement page typically does not go beyond one page and is\nusually much shorter.\nThe abstract  usually consists of a paragraph summarizing the main objectives, results,\nand conclusions. It should contain about 200 words and should not be longer than a page.\nFurthermore, it is recommended that keywords be written under the paragraph. Keywords\nare three to seven words that allow the reader to identify the topic.\nThe table of contents should list each chapter and each sub-chapter with the correspond-\ning page numbers. If it is necessary to create a sub-section, at least two sub-chapters have\nto be added to the section.\nPoor example:\n1. Introductory remarks\na) Structure of a distance learning course\n2. Literature analysis\nBetter example:\n1. Introductory remarks\n1.1 Definition of distance learning\n1.2 Forms of distance learning\n1.3 General rules of distance learning\n2. Literature analysis\nThe level of detail for the table of contents should be discussed with the supervisor. As a\nrule, however, it is recommended not to have more than three levels of headings. Too\nmany levels, such as 2.3.4.5.1, should be avoided. The chapters and sub-chapters must\nmatch the title and numbering of the text.\n100Literature review\nHere, the current state of\nresearch on the research\nquestion of the thesis is\ndiscussed.\nAppendix\nThis section contains all\ndocuments that are used\nfor deeper understanding\nand closer examination.The list of tables/figures, abbreviations, and glossary are intended to help the reader find\nrelevant additional information. If three or more tables are used, including a list of tables/\nfigures is mandatory. Traditionally, the lists of tables and figures as well as the list of\nabbreviations are included at the beginning of the thesis, and the glossary is listed after\nthe appendices.\nThe following section explains the main part of the thesis with the recommended points in\nmore detail. The main part should contain the following topics, if not otherwise agreed\nwith the supervisor:\n\u2022introduction (normally referred to as Chapter 1)\n\u2022literature review (usually referred to as Chapter 2)\n\u2022research methodology (usually referred to as Chapter 3)\n\u2022research findings (usually referred to as Chapter 4)\n\u2022conclusion (normally referred to as Chapter 5)\n\u2022recommendations/limitations (can be a separate chapter, but can also be included in\nChapter 5)\nThe introduction should include a clear description of the purpose, aims and objectives of\nthe thesis, which are expressed by means of research objectives and research questions.\nIn addition, an overview of the overall structure of the thesis should be presented.\nThe literature review  should in turn reflect a critical examination of literature relevant to\nthe topic. Relevant literature includes relevant textbooks, reference books and articles\nfrom academic journals. Students can decide for themselves how to structure the litera-\nture analysis.\nThe thesis must include a chapter explaining the applied research methods (empirical\nresearch with qualitative or quantitative methods, literature and review work or mixed\nmethods).\nThe research results should be presented in an individual chapter. It is advisable to use\ntables and visualisations here. The results are only presented here. At this point, no inter-\npretation takes place. This is followed by the interpretation of the results. Here it is impor-\ntant that they are linked to the relevant literature mentioned in the theoretical foundation\nas well as to any empirical results of one's own. Furthermore, recommendations for action\nfor the object of study are usually formulated in this chapter, which can be derived from\nthe research process.\nA conclusion (with an outlook) concludes the paper. Here, recommendations for further\nresearch and limitations that have arisen during the research process can be considered.\nThe appendix  serves to present information that is too detailed for the body, but remains\nimportant for its understanding. These can be the original copies of the surveys, large\ntables, or scanned materials and transcripts of in-depth interviews. It has to be agreed\nwith the respective supervisor whether interviews have to be transcribed and added. In\ngeneral, questionnaires, transcripts, and other information can be attached in the original\nlanguage unless the supervisor decides otherwise.\n101Affidavit\nThis declaration is placed\nat the end of the Bache-\nlor's thesis.Each appendix shall be designated with corresponding ordering, e.g., Appendix A, Appen-\ndix B. The pages in the appendix are numbered but not included in the 40 pages of the\nbody. The body of the thesis should refer to each appendix.\nThe affidavit /declaration of authenticity must be included in the thesis. It should be the\nlast page of the thesis, inserted after  the appendices. If the document is not included in\nthe paper, the thesis cannot be evaluated. The declaration can be sent to the exams office\nby post within seven working days, otherwise the thesis will be graded as \u201cfailed\u201d .\nFormal Requirements for the Text\nThe following formal requirements apply to the text of the bachelor thesis:\nTable 11: Formal IU Requirements for Bachelor Theses\nLength Dependent on course of study\nPaper size DIN-A4\nMargins Top and bottom 2 cm; left 2 cm; right 2 cm\nFont General text: Arial 11 pt.; Headings: 12 pt., justified\nLine spacing 1.5\nSentence structure Justified, auto-hyphenation\nFootnotes Arial 10 pt., justified\nParagraphs 6 pt. distance after  line break\nChapter/section levels Maximum three levels (1. Main heading, 1.1 Section, 1.1.1 Sub-\nheadings)\nOnly individual chapters in the text are numbered consecutively;\notherwise, sections of the assignment, such as the list of figures or\nthe bibliography, are not numbered.\nDo not use the underline function, and use italics sparingly to\nemphasize passages.\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nFor the supervision of the bachelor thesis, the supervisor is generally available to give\nfeedback and to answer questions that may arise during the writing of the thesis. It is,\nhowever, independent academic work and thus, is the responsibility of the student. The\nstudent should keep in mind that the thesis will be written for their distance learning pro-\ngram. This necessitates a high degree of self-organization and professionalism. Students\nmust prepare for telephone appointments and be able to send in all materials in advance\nvia email. As in modern professional life, support is provided by a virtual team via email\nand Teams/Zoom.\n102Further specification regarding the bachelor thesis as well as the Thesis Handbook can be\nfound in the course \u201cInformation Thesis General\u201d in myCampus.\n103UNIT 9\nACADEMIC WORK AT IU: ORAL\nASSIGNMENTS\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 how to structure a successful oral assignment.\n\u2013 the goal of using good supporting visuals.\n\u2013 which principles lead to a visually appealing presentation.\n\u2013 how verbal and non-verbal communication influence a presentation.\n\u2013 about the evaluation criteria used to judge the success of a presentation.9.ACADEMIC WORK AT IU: ORAL\nASSIGNMENTS\nCase Study\nMaike has completed a training at the RheCom Academy where she focused on learning\nmore about rhetoric and communication to help her with her terrible stage fright and reti-\ncence for public speaking. During her training she learned that presentations are as much\nabout body language and other types of non-verbal communication as they are about the\nwords being spoken. For the first few days at RheCom, they dealt with breathing techni-\nques and the tone, speed, and variation of speech. Then they focused on practicing the\ndelivery of a presentation, something Maike found to be incredibly helpful. She sees the\nvalue in learning these skills to be able to properly express herself in both professional\nand academic situations. Within the framework of the bachelor colloquium, it is important\nto be able to be convincing to a reader or audience while depicting scientifically-founded\nconnections. She can prepare for the colloquium with special presentations during her\nstudies.\n9.1 Oral Assignments at IU\nWith an oral assignment, the objective is to present your work content with appropriate\nand appealing visuals in order to share methodological and technical know-how with the\naudience. With enough preparation and practice, you can confidently present your work.\nThese skills are always in demand in one\u2019s professional life as often,  you are required to\nprepare and present a concrete topic to a specific audience.\nObjectives and Procedures\nIn this presentation, students demonstrate that they are able to work independently on an\nacademic topic, and that they can showcase the research in an understandable and acces-\nsible way for the audience.\nAt the beginning of every presentation, as with any written assignments, the student\nshould clearly state the research topic and relevant literature and, from this foundation,\nbe able to present, and theoretically substantiate one\u2019s own work. Subsequently, the\ndeveloped content must be presented within the given framework in a visually appealing\nway for the target audience. The presentation should be completed and presented in its\nentirety, following a straightforward outline, within the given time allowed.\nStructure\nThe concrete structure of an oral assigment is determined by the topic and its parameters.\nHowever, all presentations have the same basic components in common:\n106\u2022title slide\n\u2022outline\n\u2022introduction\n\u2022body\n\u2022conclusion\n\u2022list of figures/tables (if necessary)\n\u2022bibliography\nEach content related part of the presentation has a different  focus and goal, which should\nbe taken into account when preparing (Polonsky & Waller, 2004). The introduction identi-\nfies the subject of the presentation, its limitations, and the outline of the presentation to\nfollow. The introductory remarks should grab the audience\u2019s attention and jumpstart their\ninterest; therefore, it is advisable to choose a concrete introduction to the subject in the\nform of a daring thesis, a picture, quote, question, or the like.\nFor the body of the presentation, the now-attentive audience should follow the interesting\nand sensibly-structured, comprehensible presentation. In order to achieve this goal, the\ncontents must have a common thread woven throughout. The presentation of the topic of\ninvestigation follows the criteria of academic work in presentations, this means that the\ncontent presented verbally must also be traceable and verifiable, following with academic\nstandards.\nThe conclusion of this presentation serves to draw one's own conclusions on the basis of\nan independent analysis of the subject matter and, if necessary, to provide new perspec-\ntives. Arguments are concluded with a synthesis of what\u2019s been said. Additional manda-\ntory parts of the structure are the title slide, the outline and the bibliography at the end.\nSupporting Visuals\nUnlike classical speeches, presentations focus on facts and content. A good visualization\nof the topic is therefore essential (Polonsky & Waller, 2004, pp. 436\u2013437; Seifert, 2015 )\nbecause it should support the factual presentation. In the case of an oral assignment, sup-\nporting visuals can be created with the help of PowerPoint software.\nTo be convincing, visuals must complement and support the content being presented ver-\nbally. Therefore, the following four principles should be taken into account when creating\neach slide:\n1. Visuals help foster understanding, but they are never an end in themselves! Anima-\ntions are only appropriate if they increase understanding of the content being presen-\nted.\n2. Messages should be used instead of headlines. This means that each slide should only\ndeal with one core topic at a time and contain a well-considered \u201caction title\u201d .\n1073. A verbal description should be given before an image is shown. Before moving to the\nnext slide, presenters should tell their audience what comes next. This ensures that a\ncommon thread or theme throughout the PowerPoint presentation is maintained and\nthat the audience is not subjected to abrupt changes in topic.\n4. PowerPoint slides should be readable. The design of the slides, including the color,\nfont type, and font size, must enable easy recognition of the visual material being pre-\nsented. The slides should not be overloaded with too much information.\nFor students enrolled in bachelor degree programs, it is recommended that they refrain\nfrom experimenting with visuals if it is unclear how the audience is likely to respond.\nInstead, it is better to use pre-designed PowerPoint slide templates with suggested fonts\nand colors.\nIf the above principles are not observed, the presentation may not achieve its goals, as the\naudience may become distracted or, in the worst case, lose interest. For help in designing\nan appealing PowerPoint presentation, there are countless guidebooks and reference\nworks available (H\u00fcttmann, 2018; National Conference of State Legislatures, 2017) as well\nas many good and bad examples on the internet. Ultimately, however, the specifics of a\npresentation are a matter of personal taste.\nRhetoric and Appearance\nFor a presentation to be successful, verbal and non-verbal communication, including the\nspeaker\u2019s posture, must convey an impression of credibility. It is not only what is said that\nmatters, but how it is said.\nWith respect to verbal communication, the following four points are particularly important\nto being perceived as convincing:\n1. Voice: The easiest way for us to speak is in our individual speech pattern. This is the\nvocal range we use when we speak effortlessly  over a sustained period of time and\nwhich also varies. It conveys an authentic sound to the audience.\n2. Pronunciation (articulation): The clarity of pronunciation, otherwise referred to as the\nsharpness of articulation, is also particularly important to comprehensibility.\n3. Emphasis (accentuation): Good speakers speak in a varied manner. They consciously\nalter their voice by adjusting the volume, speed, and intonation to suit what is being\nsaid. The well-considered use of emphasis brings a presentation to life, helping to sus-\ntain audience interest.\n4. Breathing: Good breathing is necessary to being able to effortlessly  maintain speech.\nAdditionally, a good breathing technique helps to maintain an adequate speaking\nspeed, including adequate pauses for breath.\nIn addition to the verbal and non-verbal communication techniques already discussed,\nthe following non-verbal signals contribute to a successful presentation:\n1. Posture and appearance: The image conveyed by a speaker to an audience occurs\nthrough a speaker\u2019s posture, which is automatically projected onto the audience. If\nthe speaker seems bored or tense, for example, this affect  will be projected onto the\n108audience. Good speakers take advantage of this phenomenon by consciously paying\nattention to their posture, attempting to appear relaxed and confident. Paying atten-\ntion to appearance includes choice of clothing, given that what we wear also influen-\nces how we appear.\n2. Gestures: Hand gestures should accompany and support a presentation. Good speak-\ners are aware of their hand gestures and use them in a targeted manner. In order that\nhand gestures appear natural, even when they are deliberately used, some practice\non the part of the speaker is required. It is also helpful to observe the gestures of other\nspeakers, noting their effect  on the audience.\n3. Facial expressions: These are facial gestures, so to speak. Facial expressions are indi-\nvidual, but they can also be used consciously to indicate and trigger emotions. Cau-\ntion: Unconsciously, our facial expressions often  show others what we are \u201creally\u201d\nthinking, and this can stand in stark contrast to what has been said.\n4. Eye contact: Even in professional presentations recorded online, eye contact must be\nestablished between the speaker and the audience. This is best achieved when the\ncamera is seen as an imaginary conversation partner and consciously looked at from\ntime to time.\nThe communication techniques discussed here are individualized and their successful use\nrequires good practice. If you want to check your posture, facial expressions, and gestures,\nit is best to stand in front of a large mirror. The presentation itself, with all its technical,\nvisual, and rhetorical facets, should also be rehearsed several times. A mirror can also act\nas a training partner. However, more direct feedback can be obtained from another per-\nson.\nFormal Requirements and Evaluation Criteria\nOral assignments are recorded using the Bongo tool. Information on how to register and\nuse the tool are described in detail in the Bongo user manual.\nAn oral assignment lasts 15 minutes. During the presentation, the speaker has to take care\nto stay in time. A PowerPoint presentation, which must be converted into a PDF file before\nuploading to the Bongo tool, provides visual support to the presentation. Important:\nUnlike a colloquium, there is no discussion at the end.\nIt should be noted that in terms of content, the presentation should be complete, follow a\nclear structure, and abide by the given time limit. The core parts of the presentation are\nthe introduction, the structure, the quality of argument and the conclusion, which when\nweighted together equal 70 percent of the grade. The rhetorical features and supporting\nvisuals used are weighted at 30 percent, and are, therefore, important components of the\noral assignment.\nFurther specification and guidelines can be found in the respective Exam Guide in myCam-\npus and the guidelines of particular courses.\n109UNIT 10\nACADEMIC WORK AT IU: ORAL PROJECT\nREPORTS\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 how to structure a successful oral project report.\n\u2013 why using graphics in an oral project report is important.\n\u2013 which principles lead to a visually appealing oral project report.\n\u2013 how verbal and non-verbal communication influence an oral project report.\n\u2013 about the evaluation criteria used to judge the success of an oral project report.10. ACADEMIC WORK AT IU: ORAL PROJECT\nREPORTS\nCase Study\nIt is a big challenge for Simon to present the entire process of a project, and its results, to a\nlarge audience. It has therefore been particularly important for him to follow a clear struc-\nture throughout his projects in order to then present the results, findings, and future uses\nto a larger audience. It has also been important for Simon to show visual representations\nof his projects throughout various presentations. Throughout the course of many projects,\nhe created photo logs so that he had some good, descriptive material that he could use\nduring his oral project reports. Looking back, however, he is particularly proud of the fact\nthat he chose to begin so many of his presentations with an interactive introduction,\nwhich turned out to be very successful. By creating a \u201creflective team\u201d through a short,\ninteractive audience survey, he not only had the full attention and focus of the audience,\nbut it also helped quell his nerves, given that within the first few minutes of the presenta-\ntion he lost the feeling of being directly at the center of attention.\n10.1 Oral Project Reports at IU\nObjectives and Procedures\nThe oral presentation of an independently designed, implemented, and documented\nproject stands at the center of an oral project report. A successful presentation demon-\nstrates that students are able to transfer their theoretical knowledge into practice within\nthe framework of a specific project. Students also demonstrate that they can prepare and\npresent a project in such a way that it becomes understandable and accessible to an aca-\ndemic audience. The main aim of a presentation is therefore, to familiarize the audience\nwith the process followed in the project and to present the project\u2019s results.\nA topic must be identified and planning of the project must take place during the early\nstages of preparing a presentation, which is then followed by implementation of the\nproject and its documentation. Once the overall project has been completed, individual\naspects of the project are to be structured in such a way that they can be understood by\nan audience. Only at this stage are the actual presentation and supporting visuals created\nand prepared. Particular care must be taken to ensure that both the process followed in\nthe project and the results are clearly formulated and presented.\nStructure\nIn terms of content, the structure of a presentation is determined by how different  phases\nof the project were carried out. However, all presentations have the same basic compo-\nnents in common:\n112\u2022title slide\n\u2022outline\n\u2022introduction\n\u2022body\n\u2022conclusion\n\u2022list of figures/tables (if necessary)\n\u2022bibliography\nEach content related component has a particular focus and a goal that should be taken\ninto account when preparing the topic (Polonsky & Waller, 2004). The Introduction serves\nas a guide to the project, explaining the topic and briefly introducing the structure of the\npresentation. Importantly, the introduction should arouse attention and interest. There-\nfore, it is advisable to choose an engaging way to introduce the subject of the presenta-\ntion, such as a daring thesis, image, or quote.\nA description of how the project was implemented alongside its results should be given in\nthe body of the presentation. Although each project is individual, a presentation can be\nstructured based on the following questions:\n\u2022What was or were the goals of the project?\n\u2022How was the project completed? What preparatory measures were taken (data collec-\ntion, data analysis, material evaluation, etc.)?\n\u2022What planning/organizational activities were necessary?\n\u2022Why was the project conducted in the way it was?\n\u2022Which methodology or other tools were chosen and why?\n\u2022Who were the stakeholders?\n\u2022Was a risk analysis undertaken? If so, what were the results?\n\u2022What were the main planning or project phases?\n\u2022How was the project structured?\n\u2022How did the project progress?\n\u2022How was the project scheduled? When did it start and end?\n\u2022What resources and costs were involved?\n\u2022Were the objectives achieved? What results were achieved? Did the results correspond\nwith the goals of the project? If not, why not?\n\u2022What conclusions can be drawn from the project? What could be improved if necessary?\n\u2022If applicable, what reflections arose from the project with respect to deadlines and\noverall results?\n\u2022If applicable, what reflections arose from the project with respect to required resources\nand costs?\nNote: The rules for academic work also apply to these presentations, meaning that the\nresults presented in an oral presentation must also be verifiable and replicable.\nThe presentation should end with a conclusion that provides answers to all questions\nraised throughout the presentation and that reflects on the objectives achieved in the\nproject. If it makes sense, a final review of potential follow-up projects can also be given.\nAdditional mandatory parts of the structure are the title slide, the outline and the bibliog-\nraphy at the end.\n113Supporting Visuals\nOral project reports focus on the process followed during a project and the project\u2019s\nresults. Visuals are presented with the help of software  such as PowerPoint. Individual\nPowerPoint slides should illustrate the process of a project and the project\u2019s results in the\ntruest sense of the word. It is therefore advisable to also use graphics or the SmartArt tool\nin PowerPoint in a targeted manner.\nIn order to be convincing, visuals must complement and support the content being pre-\nsented verbally. Therefore, the following four principles should be taken into account\nwhen creating each slide:\n\u2022Visuals help foster understanding, but they are never an end in themselves! Animations\nare also only appropriate if they increase understanding of the content being presented.\n\u2022Messages should be used instead of headlines. This means that each slide should only\ndeal with one core topic at a time and contain a well-considered \u201caction title\u201d .\n\u2022A verbal description should be given before an image is shown. The audience must be\nverbally prepared by the presentation of slides before they are presented. This ensures\nthat a common thread or theme throughout the PowerPoint presentation is maintained\nand that the audience is not subjected to abrupt changes in topic.\n\u2022PowerPoint slides should be easily readable. The design of the slides, including the\ncolor, font, and font size, must enable easy recognition of the visual material being pre-\nsented. PowerPoint slides should also not be overloaded with too much information.\nFor students enrolled in bachelor degree programs, it is recommended that they refrain\nfrom experimenting with visuals if it is unclear how the audience will respond. Instead, it is\nbetter to use pre-designed PowerPoint slide templates with suggested fonts and colors.\nIf the above principles are not observed, the presentation may not achieve its goals, as the\naudience may become distracted or, in the worst case, lose interest in the topic being pre-\nsented.

The core parts of the presentation are\nthe definition of the task, its structure, and the implementation of the project process,\nwhich when weighted together equal 35 percent of the grade. The originality of the\napproach taken to the solution is weighted at 20 percent and the quality of the solution(s)\nat 15 percent, which are both taken into account in the evaluation. The rhetorical features\nand supporting visuals used are weighted at 30 percent, and are important components of\nthis presentation.\nFurther specification and guidelines can be found in the respective Exam Guide in myCam-\npus and the guidelines of particular courses.\n116UNIT 11\nACADEMIC WORK AT IU: THE COLLOQUIUM\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 the components of a colloquium.\n\u2013 the objective of a colloquium.\n\u2013 what interdisciplinary evaluation criteria are applied in a colloquium.\n\u2013 the tips and hints available to prepare yourself for this unique exam.11. ACADEMIC WORK AT IU: THE\nCOLLOQUIUM\nCase Study\nSimon and Maike have received initial positive feedback from their bachelor thesis super-\nvisors about how their bachelor theses are coming along. Now they need to prepare for\nthe colloquium. The colloquium summarizes the entire process and the essential contents\nand findings of the bachelor thesis so that students can explain and defend the knowledge\nthey gained as well as show improved scientific performance. Simon and Maike are well\naware that it is not only a question of presenting the process and the results, but also of\npreparing themselves for overarching questions and proposals for discussion on the part\nof the examiners. The examiners would like to see to what extent both students are able to\nconnect logical and causal arguments for their work, as well as to discuss them controver-\nsially and place them within a larger framework. Therefore, both students use one another\nto practice the colloquium several times in advance. This is the perfect opportunity to time\ntheir presentation to make sure they do not go over their allotted timeframe. Both Simon\nand Maike have a red card to discreetly signal three to five minutes before the presenta-\ntion time runs out, so that the speaker knows to finish as quickly as possible.\n11.1 The Colloquium at IU\nThe colloquium occurs at the end of the bachelor program and thus marks the end of sev-\neral years of intensive study on various subjects. It is of course a performance review, how-\never its characteristics differ  significantly from the oral exams taken during the course of\nstudy. This unit considers the unique position of the colloquium.\nObjectives and Procedure\nThe colloquium takes place after  the submission and positive assessment of the bachelor\nthesis and serves primarily as proof that the written thesis has been completed in full.\nThere are two major components for this: (1) the presentation of the written work and (2)\na discussion of the contents with the examiners.\nThe invitation to the colloquium is issued by the examiner of the bachelor thesis and is a\nsure sign that the bachelor thesis has been passed. Admission to this partial exam is gran-\nted by the Examination Office  and the guidelines and forms deposited in myCampus\nshould be read in advance of the bachelor thesis. The colloquium will be held either at a\nstudy site of IU, or online, independent of location, for example via Teams. In any case, it is\nimportant to consult the supervisor in a reasonable amount of time.\n118After  the approximately 30-minute colloquium, the student is asked to leave the (virtual)\nroom briefly so that the examiners can discuss and agree upon their evaluation. The stu-\ndent is then invited back in and receives direct feedback. After  the successful completion\nof all modules, including the bachelor thesis and colloquium, the diploma is issued and\nsent by mail.\nPresentation\nThe colloquium usually starts with a presentation. The presentation should show the\nwhole research process, starting with the research question and finishing with the conclu-\nsion. This should usually last 15 minutes. To avoid problems, use Microsoft  Office  Power-\nPoint for the presentation.\nFollow the typical three-part structure of a presentation so that the first part of the collo-\nquium is roughly structured as follows:\n1. Introduction\n2. Body\n3. Conclusion\nAfter  capturing the audience\u2019s interest through the introduction, one moves into the body\nof the thesis presentation. As this presentation is geared toward an academic audience,\nthe content should be both intellectually demanding but also plausible and understanda-\nble. It is important to emphasize the innovative points of the written explanation and to\nonly briefly refer to the starting point of the work, as the focus should be on one\u2019s own\nefforts  and learning. Keep in mind that the entire research process and results should be\npresented; simply selecting certain aspects to share is not sufficient.  The conclusion of the\ncolloquium presents the findings of the bachelor thesis and, if possible, provides new per-\nspectives. There should also be a synthesis of what has been said during the presentation,\nsummarizing the student\u2019s argumentation.\nBefore the colloquium, it is advisable to discuss with the supervisor whether (subject-spe-\ncific) particulars should be taken into account for the presentation.\nDiscussion\nIn the subsequent question-and-answer session, the aim is to defend both the bachelor\nthesis and the presentation. Since the primary purpose of a defense is to provide ade-\nquate linguistic and content-related justification for what has been said or written and for\nthe conclusion reached, the most probable \u201cwhy\u201d questions are to be expected regarding\nthe general topic of the thesis and the methodological approach.\nEvaluation Criteria\nBoth components of the colloquium will be assessed on an interdisciplinary basis using\nthe following four criteria:\n1191. Understanding and applying scientific analytical methods,\n2. Structure and content of the presentation,\n3. Ability to defend the bachelor thesis academically, and\n4. Content and logical consistency of answers to exam questions.\nFrom this it becomes clear that, in addition to pure subject-specific knowledge, methodo-\nlogical and rhetorical competences are also assessed. These abilities and skills develop\ncontinuously during a course of study and should be consciously trained and improved\nupon starting at the beginning of a student\u2019s time at university.\nNotes for Preparation\nThe colloquium is a special performance review that students can start working toward\nfrom the very beginning of their course of study. The preparation therefore also differs  sig-\nnificantly from other types of exams. Here are hints that will help you prepare.\n1. Determine (and implement) your own preferences for supporting visuals. Although\nslide and presentation designs should follow certain basic rules, their concrete design\ncan be individual and thematic, as well as subject-specific. In preparation for the col-\nloquium, reflect on which aspects and design criteria are important to you and then\u2014\nin compliance with general requirements\u2014implement your personal preferences. This\nlends authenticity to the presentation and takes the individual learning processes into\naccount.\n2. Keep in the forefront of your mind your own individual work. It is important to have\nyour own written bachelor thesis present. It is best to read the thesis again shortly\nbefore the colloquium and refresh any forgotten background knowledge.\n3. Prepare discussions. The possible questions in the colloquium are probably the most\nfeared part of this exam, both in terms of their content and the (virtual) face-to-face\nsituation. It can be helpful while reviewing your thesis to think about likely questions\nand formulate answers. In addition, looking at the expos\u00e9 of the bachelor thesis can\nalso help: What did I want back then? What have I ultimately been able to achieve?\n4. Have \u201cstandard work\u201d at the ready. The written bachelor thesis is the basis of the col-\nloquium, the \u201cstandard work\u201d so to speak. In consultation with the supervisor, you\nshould therefore have this printed and within reach during the colloquium.\n5. Use technical jargon. During your studies, you read countless sources and listened to\nmany experts. These experiences can prove highly useful here. It is advisable to\nreview topic-specific terms, keywords, and name experts in the field, etc. in the run-\nup to the colloquium so that you can respond adequately to the discussion.\n6. Consult with your supervisor. Colloquia are a little bit different  depending on the\nsupervisor, so you should always consult him/her to avoid possible misunderstand-\nings. It is advisable to collect and discuss the questions on the individual sections of\nthe bachelor thesis module. (Don't forget: document answers!)\n7. Practice, practice, practice. The presentation part can (and should) be practiced as\noften  as possible so that nothing stands in the way of a clear presentation.\nFurther information regarding the colloquium can be found in the Thesis Handbook.\n120UNIT 12\nACADEMIC WORK AT IU: PORTFOLIOS\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 the types and varieties of portfolios.\n\u2013 the advantages of an online portfolio.\n\u2013 what goes into the portfolio evaluation.\n\u2013 what role each phase of portfolio development has on the evaluation.\n\u2013 how the formalities for the end product are defined.12. ACADEMIC WORK AT IU: PORTFOLIOS\nCase Study\nSimon accomplished his goal and successfully completed his bachelor degree in business\nstudies at IU. He is now an economist and happy that he has a few months to relax and\njust focus on work; however, he already knows that he would like to enroll relatively seam-\nlessly into the Master's program in Marketing Management. His boss has bigger things\nplanned for him and predicts that Simon will have a very active role in the future reorgani-\nzation of the management of zielNET . Simon chose this Master\u02bcs program because he often\ndeals with marketing as well as management in his new role at work. Simon is pleased to\ndiscover that it includes a number of creative modules such as Digital Design and Design\nThinking, as this is precisely where Simon would like to develop his skills further and gain\nactual experience and practice in operative design and in the creation of brands. In his\nannual review with his boss, in which they also discuss his new academic venture, his boss\nencourages him to start building a portfolio from the very beginning of his new program.\nThe creative design processes require a lot of time, space, effort,  and patience. Simon's\nboss explains to him how important it is to document his learning and development proc-\ness in a digital format, i.e., in a portfolio. This portfolio can be used as a starting point in\nconversations with real design professionals. Critical in this phase is getting to know one-\nself as a designer, developing an individual style, and creating authentic, practical models\nand samples to showcase.\nThis advice sets Simon up to be able to answer the following questions when developing\nhis portfolio:\n\u2022How can I compete and stand out from the crowd?\n\u2022How can I learn the necessary practical skills and study methods that are expected of\nme as a creative designer?\n\u2022How do I build up my personal brand and how does successful self-marketing work?\n\u2022How can I optimally present my acquired know-how and projects to future employers\nand clients?\n12.1 Portfolios at IU\nA preliminary note: A portfolio evaluation occurs in many subject areas. In this unit, the\nexample used throughout this unit comes from the Bachelor in Communication Design\nprogram. This example was chosen because it provides the general requirements for the\nevaluation in such a way as to be transferrable to other areas of study.\nTypes and Sizes\n(Self-)marketing in the context of the portfolio:\n122The portfolio is the most important self-marketing tool for designers, however it is also\nbecoming increasingly relevant in other academic areas. A portfolio should be created and\nadded to over the course of study. Relevant professional websites and journals provide a\nhelpful overview of what should be considered when creating a portfolio and what advan-\ntages it can bring.\nThe portfolio, which primarily serves the purpose of advertising and \u201cself-marketing\u201d , cor-\nresponds to the definition of a presentation portfolio according to Baumgartner (2012, pp.\n49\u201354) . Some advantages of an online portfolio compared to a hard-copy portfolio are\noutlined here:\n\u2022less effort  and more time for the actual exciting projects,\n\u2022automatic content for personal marketing via social and professional networks,\n\u2022no knowledge of coding is needed with a good and intuitive tool,\n\u2022in contrast to offline  portfolios, the online portfolio can be quickly forwarded to interes-\nted parties, potential employers, and clients, and\n\u2022it is the best possible way of showing potential clients your personality with little effort,\nallowing you to stand out from the crowd.\nThere are further advantages to creating a portfolio within the specific evaluation frame-\nwork provided by the university. In design studies, for example, students gain more prac-\ntice conveying design through the use of practical concepts, methods, or tools. Courses of\nstudy with a strong connection to design are dependent on this relevant association and\nsupportive reflection during the design processes. The individual learning and evaluation\nprocess should be documented and supported in ways that include reflection on the proc-\ness itself. This type of portfolio corresponds to a reflection portfolio (Baumgartner, 2012,\npp. 49\u201354).\nWith the help of a portfolio, students can document their personal learning path through\nthe submission of a diversity of assignments that constitute their portfolios. As part of an\nonline portfolio, students can present selected assignments and projects\u2014from the initial\nidea to the finished product\u2014to interested parties and potential clients. Similar to a mod-\nel\u2019s photo portfolio, the students are accompanied through the development of their\ndesign projects by the lecturers, in an advisory capacity, from the first sketch to the fin-\nished product.\nDocumentation over time of a student\u2019s own development of qualifications and compe-\ntencies in terms of their career is referred to as a development portfolio ( Baumgartner,\n2012, pp. 49\u201354).\nIn summary, the portfolios differ  in their use and objectives, depending on their nature\nand structure:\n\u2022Presentation portfolios are primarily used for job applications and \u201cself-marketing\u201d .\n\u2022Reflection portfolios document and reflect the individual learning and evaluation proc-\ness.\n\u2022Development portfolios show the long-term development of qualifications and compe-\ntencies with regard to one\u2019s professional career.\n123Evaluation Process\nHow is the evaluation of a portfolio at IU structured? In order to develop a product as part\nof the portfolio evaluation, a multi-stage iterative process is necessary. This is reflected in\ndifferent  phases and iterative processes. The basic structure of this evaluation usually fol-\nlows the following pattern:\n1. Conception phase: conceptualize/sketch/scribble/raw design\n2. Development/reflection phase: definition of (design) parameters/digital design/inter-\nmediate step(s)/correction phase(s)/reflection\n3. Finalization phase: End product\nAlong these phases, a total of three portfolio parts need to be submitted in this specific\nsequence and in the detailed format described in the guidelines.\nThe conception phase defines an initial concept with sketches, scribbles, or raw designs of\nthe desired product. If possible, this is to be done with pen and paper as part of an initial\nbrainstorming session. These sketches should be submitted to the tutor together with an\ninitial concept in writing, no longer than half of a page (DIN A4).\nAfter  the tutor evaluates the sketches and concept and gives feedback for changes and\nimprovements, the second phase of development begins. In this second phase, the\nparameters are defined and a first digital design is created with the appropriate software.\nIn the communication design example, parameters would include aspects such as form,\ncolor, and font. Information on the desired parameters can be found in the corresponding\nguide of the respective course/module on myCampus. In the second phase, intermediate\nsteps leading to the end product are developed. Depending on scope and complexity, sev-\neral intermediate steps may be necessary and can, for example, continue to be accompa-\nnied in a reflective manner by online tutorials and support from the tutor.\nThe end product is created in the finalization phase. It is submitted together with a two-\npage abstract. The basis for this abstract is the original concept. Further formalities for the\nevaluation can be found in the guidelines.\nTable 12: Overview of the Audit Performance Portfolio\nStage Intermediate result Performance to be submitted\nConception phase Portfolio part 1 Concept presentation in text form\n(approx. 1/2 page); sketch / moodboard /\ndraft,  etc.\nFeedback\nDevelopment / reflection\nphasePortfolio part 2 Explanation of implementation in text\nform (approx. 1/2 page), first digital draft  /\nmilestone / intermediate step\nFeedback\n124Stage Intermediate result Performance to be submitted\nFinalization phase Portfolio part 3 Two-page abstract (making of), final prod-\nuct (action), digital signature (optional),\nlinking OneDrive Business folder (incl. all\nfiles)\nFeedback + Grade\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nConception Phase\nA new corporate design for the bicycle brand \u201cURBAN DYNAMIC SYSTEMS\u201d is being devel-\noped. Initial steps include online research to find inspiration that will shape the develop-\nment process. For example, it is important to analyze topics such as the history of the\ncompany, relevant colors, shapes, and societal influences.\nIn addition, milestones of the design process are illustrated within the framework of the\npreviously mentioned processes using the example of a logo design for URBAN DYNAMIC\nSYSTEMS. After  the research, the creation of several first sketches (scribbles) should take\nplace; see the figure below as an example.\nFigure 10: Phases of the Design Process: Scribbles/Sketches and Logo\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nThese first sketches are supported by the design concept. After  an evaluation and feed-\nback by the tutor on how to proceed, the second phase follows.\n125Development/Reflection Phase\nNow it\u2019s time to create the first digital sketch using the recommended software.\nFigure 11: Phases of the Design Process: First Digital Draft,  Variations of Logo\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nAfter  a short evaluation and feedback by the tutor on how to proceed, the development of\nthe intermediate steps leading up to the completion of the final product in the finalization\nphase usually follows.\nFurther intermediate steps follow, as illustrated in the following figures.\n126Figure 12: Phases of the Design Process: Second Digital Draft,  Detailed Variations of\nLogo\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\n127Figure 13: Phases of the Design Process: Third Digital Draft,  Rotated Variations of Logo\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nFigure 14: Phases of the Design Process: The House Font\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\n128Figure 15: Phases of the Design Process: Fourth Digital Draft,  Variations of Logo with\nText\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nFinalization Phase: The Final Product\nThe last milestone is the final product. The final product is submitted together with a two-\npage abstract. The basis for this abstract is the original concept. Furthermore, the final\nversion should be prepared and supported with more information about the design proc-\ness, the parameters, and the software  used.\nThe following is an example of an overview of the selected typography and the final logo\nfor the end product:\n129Figure 16: Phases of the Design Process: End-Product, Logo with Text\nSource: Bilz & Schneider, 2017.\nFormal Guidelines and Submission Requirements\nThe assignments are delivered as part of the portfolio evaluation via the PebblePad portal.\nDetailed instructions on how to submit work can be found in a separate manual on\nmyCampus. It is not possible to submit the information by email or by other means.\nHere, too, the affidavit  has to be assented to.\nFormal Requirements for the Abstract\nThe following formal guidelines apply to the text of the abstract:\nTable 13: Formal IU Requirements for Portfolio Abstracts\nLength 2 pages of text\nPaper size DIN-A4\nMargins Top and bottom 2 cm; left 2 cm; right 2 cm\nFont General text: Arial 11 pt.; Headings: 12 pt., justified\nLine spacing 1.5\nSentence structure Justified, with auto-hyphenation\n130Footnotes Arial 10 pt., justified\nParagraph 6 pt. Distance after  line break\nSource: Created on behalf of IU (2020).\nTask\nOne or more topics for the portfolio are proposed in the specific course. Typically, stu-\ndents are expected to complete a theory-based, conceptually-structured, and practice-ori-\nented implementation of the product, ideally linked to the student's profession. Details on\nthe topic and tasks of the portfolios are provided in the students\u2019 respective courses. Any\nquestions regarding the assignment can then be coordinated with the respective tutor.\nGenerally, there are several channels open to a supervision of the portfolio. The respective\nuse is in the own area of responsibility. The independent development of a product and\nthe filling of the particular portfolio parts is part of the examination to be performed and is\nincluded in the overall assessment.\nFurther specification and guidelines can be found in the Exam Guide in myCampus and\nthe guidelines of particular courses.\n131UNIT 13\nACADEMIC WORK AT IU: EXAMS\nSTUDY GOALS\nOn completion of this unit, you will have learned ...\n\u2013 out of all the different  performance reviews, what is meant by the term \u201cexam\u201d .\n\u2013 the difference  between a module and a course.\n\u2013 how an exam is structured.\n\u2013 what type of exam you can take.13. ACADEMIC WORK AT IU: EXAMS\nCase Study\nIU students, Meike and Simon, are approaching their final exams for their respective cour-\nses. They wonder how things will proceed. They find out that it is possible to either take\nthe exam online at home or at an examination center on a specified date and time. Meike\nprefers the flexible option; she will complete the exam online\u2014she has no problem with\nvirtual testing and video interface and wants to do the exam once she is ready. For Simon,\nthe idea of sitting in front of a camera and having to concentrate on the exam questions is\npretty unsettling. He appreciates the fact that he can set up the exam dates himself at an\nactual physical location which will help to provide structure to his studying more easily.\n13.1 Exams at IU\nIn this unit, an important form of examination at IU is explained in more detail\u2014the exam\nas a performance review. The exam is one of the most central and common forms of test-\ning knowledge at IU. It can be achieved with maximum flexibility, according to one's own\npreferences, and can be practiced in advance, thus reducing exam anxiety and deadline\npressure (Fern\u00e1ndez-Castillo & Caurcel, 2015). A written exam is used to test the students\u2019\nknowledge of relevant subject matter and various questions are asked to test the stu-\ndents\u2019 knowledge acquisition.\nDefinition\nA written examination \u201cis to be carried out under supervision according to a set amount of\ntime, whereby its scope and content as well as the degree of independent scientific ach-\nievement are determined by the course of study\u201d (Theisen as cited in Koeder & Hamm,\n1999, p. 255, author translation). Here, not only factual knowledge is delivered, but also\n\u201ccertain facts are to be processed in an application- and problem-oriented way\u201d ( Koeder &\nHamm, 1999, p. 255, author translation).\nGeneral Information\nThere are certain guidelines for a written exam. The corresponding examiner determines\nand communicates the support materials allowed during the test. These, as well as other\nguidelines, such as approved legal texts, are set in myCampus (please consult the latest\nversion). The entire content of the course book is covered in the exams. This serves as\nproof that the content of the course book has been learned. In addition, a transfer task is\nalso required. This means that the knowledge learned from the course book needs to be\napplied independently and transferred to different  cases.\nThe exam duration depends on the number of credits (ECTS) earned for the module/\ncourse:\n134\u20225 ECTS in the module = 90 minutes exam duration\n\u202210 ECTS in the module = 2 examinations of 90 minutes each\nExceptions:\n\u202210 ECTS language courses (old): 180 minutes exam duration.\n\u202210 ECTS in the module: These modules in Master's programs usually consist of a written\nexam of and other exams.\nThe module manual provides an overview of the courses and the associated ECTS.\nIf an exam is the chosen type of performance review for a module, a sample exam, includ-\ning a sample solution, is provided. If there is currently no sample in a module, it is in pro-\ngress. A sample exam of this kind can be found in myCampus in the respective course and\nis for practical purposes only. An overview of the structure, format, as well as the point\ndistribution used, is provided. However, these do not have the same extent of questions as\nactual exams. Moreover, the availability of such a model exam is not a prerequisite for\npassing the actual exam.\nIn the exam the respective task is always to be read very carefully! In single-choice ques-\ntions, only one possible answer is correct. If several answers are ticked, no points are\nawarded. Both positive and negative questions can occur. In the case of open-ended ques-\ntions, particular attention should be paid to single words and terms in the question. With\nthe help of key words in the exam question, studens can detect the level of academic per-\nformance expected for the task at hand, examples are: name, describe, explain and illus-\ntrate.\nHow Can I Take an Exam?\nThe General Examination Regulation ( Allgemeinen Pr\u00fcfungsordnung APO ) set up in\nmyCampus, stipulate that there are two types of examinations:\n1. Written exam. Here, the exam must be written by hand on site at an examination or\nstudy center. The choice of the examination or study center is left up to the students.\nThe same applies to the examination date, which is offered  by IU twice a month.\nActual dates and examination centers are listed in myCampus.\n2. Online exam. Here, the exam is conducted online using live supervision (proctoring).\nThe exam location and time can be determined individually by the students, however,\nthis must comply with the guidelines of the online exam, found in myCampus.\nFurthermore, there is the possibility of taking a free online trial exam with a supervisor\n(proctor). This does not include any subject-specific technical questions, but offers  the\nopportunity to test the technical equipment and get more comfortable with the entire set-\nting. IU strongly recommends taking advantage of this offer  in order to avoid possible\ntechnical problems during the actual exam and to get to know the procedure of an online\nexam.\nA trial exam without a proctor can be practiced at any time.\n135The questions for the written and online exams come from the same pool of questions.\nThis means that any question from a written exam can also occur in an online exams\u2014and\nvice versa.\nFurther Information\nFurther information about exams can be found in myCampus under the section \u201cFAQ \u2013\nExams\u201d .\n136BACKMATTERLIST OF REFERENCES\nArrington, E.

    "Guideline for Avoiding Plagiarism.pdf",
    " \n Page  1of 3 \nMisprints and errors are reserved .    Date  03/22 /2021  EXAMS OFFICE  \nIU.ORG  \n \n GUIDELINE  FOR  AVOIDING  PLAGIARISM   \n \nYOUR FIRST WRITTEN A SSIGNMENT?   \nHOW DO I START? WHER E DO I START?  \n Without the necessary support, it can turn into an enormous challenge and lead to students feeling completely \noverworked and stressed.  Many of these problems and difficulties often occur after the written assignment has \nbeen turned in, in the form of a pr oof of plagiarism. An accurate citation format is the linchpin of a written \nassignment . Before you start writing, it is crucial to clarify what the accurate citation format is. Unfortunately, we \nhave often had the experience that students receive the proof  of plagiarism, which isn\u2019t traced back to an attempt \nof cheating, but simply uncertainty. For this reason, the IU hopes that these guidelines help clarify all issues \nrelating to plagiarism so that unnecessary mistakes can be avoided.  \n1. WHAT  IS PLAGIARISM?  \nPlagiarism can generally be understood as the unauthorized usage of foreign intellectual property, or rather the \ntheft thereof (Fr\u00f6hlich, 2006, S. 81) where another\u2019s efforts are presented as one\u2019s own (Schimmel, 2011, S. 5).  \nPlagiarism isn\u2019t always plagia rism, though. There are different types of plagiarism, with different dimensions.   \nFirst an foremost , there  is a difference between usin g passages of text, using forei gn intellectual property, and the \nusage of one\u2019s own, previously published ideas (H\u00f6hner  & Steinhauer, 2014, S. 27).  When speaking about the \ntransfer of passages of text , a distinction is made between full and partial plagiarism .  \nFull plagiarism  \n- In the form of a full plagiarism, either most of the paper or all of it is completely taken from a single literary \nsource and then released as one\u2019s own work. This is done, for example, by switching out the cover sheet, or \nby simply reformatting the work plagiarized by the author.  \n- Furthermore, one also speaks of a full plagiarism when a work in a for eign language is translated into one\u2019s \nown language. In all of these cases, it is referred to as intellectual property theft.  \n- Another form of full plagiarism occurs when a ghostwriter is paid for having written the entire paper. (Ebster, \n2011).  \nPartial pl agiarism  \n- In contrast to this is the so -called partial plagiarism, where the entire work is not plagiarized from one source, \nbut rather from several sources and incorporated into several different passages of the text. (H\u00f6hner & \nSteinhauer, 2014, S. 27).  In the case of a plagiarism, which is not due to a literal adoption of a passage of text, \nbut rather the adoption of foreign ideas and arguments, one speaks of a so -called plagiarism of  ideas. Here, \nthe ideas or arguments are presented in the author\u2019s own words, but also mistakenly presented as the \nauthor\u2019s own work (ebd., S. 27).  \n- Additionally,  it can also  take  the form  of an \u201eindividual  plagiarism\u201d.  The  author  of a research  paper  is naturally \nallowed  to use his thoughts, arguments or his ideas more than once. This does, however,  need  to be \nreferenced  throughout  the paper.  In this  case,  should  the author fail  to reference  his first  publication in the \npaper, this falls under self -plagiarism.  While there is no evidence of theft of other  people\u2019s  intellectual  \nproperty,  the reader  is entitled  to the topicality  of the idea  and  knowledge  of the respective  background (ebd.,  \nS. 27).   \n Page  2of 3 \nMisprints and errors are reserved .    Date  03/22 /2021  EXAMS OFFICE  \nIU.ORG  \n \n2. TURNITIN  \n- The IU uses the plagiarism software , Turnitin . The written assignments are to be turned in here, in order to \ncheck them or rather inspect them for plagiarism.  \n- The Plagiarism software, Turnitin, gives indications or references whether sections of the assignment have \nbeen plagiarized. It is the responsibility of the examiner  to decide whether or not the assignment has been \nplagiarized.  \n- Furthermore, it is mandatory that a signed anti -plagiarism pledge is provided by the student in electronic \nform. Exceptions are final theses. Every bachelor's or m aster's thesis must contain a signed anti -plagiarism \npledge. In this Statement, the student ensures that he has completed their assignment independently.  \n3. CONSEQUENCES OF PLAG IARISM  \nIf an assignment has been turned in, where the student has plagiarized, the  student involved will receive an \nattempt at cheating. In this case, the assessment will be graded \u201e insufficient  \u201cand the Module, or rather half of \nthe module will not be acknowledged. Additionally, no credit points will be awarded.  \n \n4. HOW CAN I AVOID PLAG IARIZING? \u2013 CHECKLIST FOR THE WRITING OF A  \nRESEARCH PAPER  \n- Both time and performance pressure are often causes for plagiarism. (V\u00f6lger Winsky, 2014, S. 12). Therefore, \nit is sensible, that you create a schedule before you begin writing your assignment, in ord er to best avoid \nfeeling overly constrained by time (Reichmann, 2013, S. 181).  \n- Additionally, lack of ideas can also lead to plagiarism (Reichmann, 2013, S. 181). It is certainly permitted to \nuse unfamiliar ideas in your assignment, however, these need to b e properly identified. For this reason, it is \nimportant, even when you are doing your literature research, that you immediately identify ideas, thoughts \nor arguments which emerge as you do your research, as well as citing the associated sources.  \n- It is alwa ys good to structure newly acquired knowledge (V\u00f6lger Winsky, 2014, S. 15). Another words, while \nresearching and while creating a possible collection of quotes, be sure that you immediately cite your \nsources, so that you can avoid having to searching for y our sources later on.  \n- IMPORTANT: The Bibliography and citing of sources are as much a part of writing of the actual paper as is the \ntext itself. Always cite the sources as you are writing and update the bibliography every time you work on your \nassignment.  \n- Simply including a bibliography in your assignment is not sufficient as the sole list of references. Do not forget \nto indicate your sources in the body of text.  \n- If you would like to use verbatim quotes in your assignment, they must be cited and denoted ac cordingly. \nWith non -verbatim quotes, another words with analogous quotations, the content must be written in your \nown words. These must also be cited accordingly in the body of text.  \n- If you are unsure whether or not to cite the source, cite the source when  in doubt (Ebster, 2011).  \n- Check your assignment, before you turn it in, to make sure that your Table of Contents and the list of sources \nare complete in main body of text, and make sure that you have quoted thoughts, ideas, and or arguments \naccordingly.  \n \nWe wish you all the best as you begin writing your written assignment!  \n  \n Page  3of 3 \nMisprints and errors are reserved .
